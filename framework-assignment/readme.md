## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Clean missing and incorrect values
- Visualize trends in research publications
- Build a small web app to display the results

## Tools Used
- Python 3.8+
- pandas (data handling)
- matplotlib and seaborn (visualization)
- Streamlit (web app)
