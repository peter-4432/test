COVID-19 has been linked to a number of critical cardiovascular complications [2, 3], and even individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease are at risk of cardiovascular complications [4]. Patients with severe COVID-19 commonly experience thrombotic disorders, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and these conditions have been closely linked to higher mortality rates [1, 5, 6]. Large-scale studies have revealed that 18.8% to 36.2% of patients [7, 8] present with thrombocytopenia on admission. In addition, the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications for COVID-19 patients in the ICU was 31%, while only 1.3% of non-COVID-19 ICU patients experience thrombotic complications [9]. Although the evidence supports a link between COVID-19 and the development of a hypercoagulable state, the underlying mechanisms for this association remain elusive.",Published online 2020 Sep 4.,"Critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may develop a pro-thrombotic state that places them at a dramatically increased lethal risk. Although platelet activation is critical for thrombosis and is responsible for the thrombotic events and cardiovascular complications, the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains unclear."

The severity of the illness can also extend from mild disease to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection can also affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreatic functions, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can cause central and peripheral neurological manifestations, affect the cardiovascular system and promote renal dysfunction. Epidemiological data have indicated that cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considering the multitude of clinical symptoms of COVID-19, the objective of the present review was to summarize their pathophysiology in previously healthy patients, as well as in those with comorbidities. The present review summarizes the current, though admittedly fluid knowledge on the pathophysiology and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Although unclear issues still remain, the present study contributes to a more complete understanding of the disease, and may drive the direction of new research. The recognition of the severity of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 is crucial for the specific therapeutic management of affected patients."

Recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the endothelium during COVID-19 may exacerbate these deleterious events by inciting inflammatory and microvascular thrombotic processes. Although controversial, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may infect endothelial cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor using the viral Spike protein. In this review, we explore current insights into the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, endothelial dysfunction due to ACE2 downregulation, and deleterious pulmonary and extra-pulmonary immunothrombotic complications in severe COVID-19. We also discuss preclinical and clinical development of therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Finally, we present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human lung and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, in striving to understand the parameters that lead to severe disease in COVID-19 patients, it is important to consider how direct infection of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to this process."

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage. As the race to develop an effective vaccine intensifies, several clinical trials of antivirals and immune modulators are underway, though no reliable COVID-19-specific therapeutics (inclusive of some potentially effective single and multi-drug regimens) have been identified as of yet. With many nations and regions declaring a state of emergency, unprecedented quarantine, social distancing, and border closing efforts are underway. Implementation of social and physical isolation measures has caused sudden and profound economic hardship, with marked decreases in global trade and local small business activity alike, and full ramifications likely yet to be felt. Current state-of-science, mitigation strategies, possible therapies, ethical considerations for healthcare workers and policymakers, as well as lessons learned for this evolving global threat and the eventual return to a “new normal” are discussed in this article."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) began to emerge in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Recently, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in late 2019, and it has posed a global health threat, causing an ongoing pandemic in many countries and territories (1).",Published online 2020 Jun 24.,"In recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus."

Approximately one-fourth of subjects hospitalized with COVID-19–associated pneumonia require respiratory support in an intensive care unit (ICU), and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) has been associated with high mortality (3–5). Older age, male sex, and the presence of certain comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease) have been identified as predictors of poor outcomes (5); however, even younger and generally healthy individuals can suffer from COVID-19–associated respiratory failure (6). Both virus-specific factors and host inflammatory responses have been implicated in determining disease severity and clinical outcome (7–9).

However, the utility of specific immune-based biomarkers to predict clinical outcome remains elusive. Here, we analyzed levels of 66 soluble biomarkers in 175 Italian patients with COVID-19 ranging from mild/moderate to critical severity and assessed type I IFN–, type II IFN–, and NF-κB–dependent whole-blood transcriptional signatures. A broad inflammatory signature was observed, implicating activation of various immune and nonhematopoietic cell subsets. Discordance between IFN-α2a protein and IFNA2 transcript levels in blood suggests that type I IFNs during COVID-19 may be primarily produced by tissue-resident cells.

Of these, respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses (CoV) have proven particularly problematic to control due to their ease of human-to-human transmission and wide range of primary and secondary animal reservoirs (Assiri et al., 2013; Damas et al., 2020). They were also recently highlighted by the World Health Organization in 2018 as priority areas for research given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines (WHO, 2018). To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been identified that can induce a range of respiratory symptoms with variable case fatality rates. These include the circulating seasonal HCoVs (i.e. higher winter prevalence) that are generally considered to cause mild respiratory symptoms (αCoVs; HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, β-CoVs; HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43), through to novel CoVs that lead to severe and potentially fatal respiratory tract infections (β-CoVs; SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) (Gaunt et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2020a; Pfefferle et al., 2011). The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents with a range of respiratory symptoms which, in an estimated 14–17% of cases, leads to severe or critical disease such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Petrosillo et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Docherty et al., 2020). Although SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same β-CoV genus as the CoVs responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; caused by SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; caused by MERS-CoV), this newly emerged virus tends to be associated with milder infections. For example, depending on the country, case fatality rates from COVID-19 have been estimated to be ca. 1–5%, significantly lower than the death rates for SARS (9.5%) and MERS (35%) (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; De Wit et al., 2016; Rajgor et al., 2020; CDC, 2020). In addition, SARS and MERS are predominantly associated with nosocomial spread, whereas SARS-CoV-2 is much more widely transmitted in the community, particularly in places with high population densities such as overcrowded housing, industrial processing plants, elderly care homes, and prisons (Abrams et al., 2020; Cloud et al., 2020; Franco-Paredes et al., 2020; Petrosillo et al., 2020; Razum et al., 2020; Waltenburg et al., 2020).",null,null

Coronaviruses can infect a broad range of vertebrates, including bats, birds, pangolins, snakes, mice, and humans. Due to sequence similarities with RaTG13 bat and pangolin coronavirus strains, it is currently thought that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and has secondarily acquired human-to-human spreading capacity.3 In particular, the acquisition of i) mutations in the receptor-binding area, ii) a polybasic furin cleavage site (RRRAR) at the junction of subdomain 1 and 2 of the spike protein and iii) a site of O-linked glycosylation in the same area, have enabled the virus to efficiently interact with high affinity (via its spike protein) with its bona fide cellular receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE-2]),4 to become more virulent and pathogenic, while potentially evading immune responses through O-glycan epitope masking.3",Published online 2020 Jul 31.,"The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces has led to speculation that it can be transmitted via the fecal-oral/ocular route. This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 102–105 gc/ml) and feces (ca. 102–107 gc/ml) is much lower than in nasopharyngeal fluids (ca. 105–1011 gc/ml). There is strong evidence of multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut and infectious virus has occasionally been recovered from both urine and stool samples. The level and infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2 in vomit remain unknown. In comparison to enteric viruses transmitted via the fecal-oral route (e.g. norovirus, adenovirus), the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted via feces or urine appears much lower due to the lower relative amounts of virus present in feces/urine. The biggest risk of transmission will occur in clinical and care home settings where secondary handling of people and urine/fecal matter occurs. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA genetic material can be detected by in wastewater, this signal is greatly reduced by conventional treatment. Our analysis also suggests the likelihood of infection due to contact with sewage-contaminated water (e.g. swimming, surfing, angling) or food (e.g. salads, shellfish) is extremely low or negligible based on very low predicted abundances and limited environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2. These conclusions are corroborated by the fact that tens of million cases of COVID-19 have occurred globally, but exposure to feces or wastewater has never been implicated as a transmission vector."

They are known to infect a range of animals, including humans, and cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological diseases (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2020). Coronaviruses are further classified into four groups, namely Alpha-coronavirus (α-CoV), Beta-coronavirus (β-CoV), Gamma-coronavirus (γ-CoV) and Delta-coronavirus (δ-CoV) (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). α-CoV and β-CoV use bats and rodents as animal reservoirs, while γ-CoV and δ-CoV mostly use members of the avian species as reservoirs (Columbus et al., 2019). A total of seven human infecting coronaviruses that cause respiratory distress of various severity have been identified. These include two α-CoV (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) and two β-CoV (HCoV−OC43, HCoV-HKU1), which cause mild respiratory illness in immunocompetent individuals (Drosten et al., 2003). In addition, three highly pathogenic β-CoV [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2)] have caused outbreaks in the last two decades (Drosten et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2020a). The initial SARS-CoV outbreak occurred in China in late 2002 (Xu et al., 2004a). The virus was traced to horseshoe bats through civets that acted as an intermediate amplifying and transmitting host; the jump for a viral pathogen from the animal reservoir to human host is a crucial aspect in the emergence of the virus and helps in controlling the spread of the pathogen (Hu et al., 2017). The disease had a case fatality rate of −10 %, and around 8000 confirmed cases were reported in the two years of the outbreak as of December 2003 (World Health Organisation, 2004). This was followed by the MERS-CoV outbreak that started in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in late 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012). The virus is believed to have been originated in bats and subsequently transmitted to camels in the distant past (Widagdo et al., 2019). The MERS-CoV has a case fatality rate of −35 % and −2500 confirmed cases were reported until January 2020 across the planet (World Health Organization, 2020a). Sporadic identification of MERS-CoV cases have been reported across countries since then, unlike SARS-CoV (no reported cases since 2004).",Published online 2020 Dec 10.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance."

The pathogen responsible for COVID-19 was initially isolated from individuals with severe pneumonia of then-unknown cause in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, the epicenter of the outbreak in December 2019 (Lu et al., 2020a). The pathogen was identified as the seventh coronavirus that could infect humans and was named as SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with the sister virus, SARS-CoV (outbreak caused in 2003), (Gorbalenya et al., 2020 and Wu et al., 2020a). Since the initial cases in Wuhan were presented from and around the local seafood market or wet market, which is also a hub for live animal trading, an animal to human transmission of the virus was suggested (Singhal, 2020). Initially, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been controversial. While natural evolution from precursor viruses was a possibility, some scientists believed that it was genetically engineered in a laboratory that was working on bat CoV- RaTG13. However, the latter has been rejected since the nucleotide difference between the two viruses is distributed throughout the genome randomly instead of more targeted and logical insertions as would be expected in synthetic constructs, making RatG13 unlikely a direct source for SARS-Cov-2 (Liu et al., 2020). On a genomic level, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to RatG13 (96.2%) and pangolin-CoV (91.02%) than SARS-CoV (70%), indicating both bats, and pangolins could be the reservoir hosts Zhang et al., 2020a. The SARS-CoV-2 could have been originated from a precursor that underwent natural selection in one of the animal hosts like bats or pangolins under high population density. Alternatively, it might have jumped to humans from the animal hosts and evolved through human to human transmissions. Finally, a less likely accidental laboratory release of a progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 itself (Andersen et al., 2020) cannot be ruled out. Another debate that is uprising among the scientific community is the number of strains present for SARS-CoV-2. Genome analysis of the viral isolates from different countries report mutations in both coding and non-coding regions of the virus genome. Based on SNPs genotyping of 103 sequences, two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed-the S and the L subtype, where the L subtype has been evolved from S subtype (Tang et al., 2020a). A mutation in the spike protein D614G has been deemed to be of vital concern as the researchers claim it furnished high transmissibility to SARS-CoV-2 (Bhattacharyya et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the more important question is if these and many other mutations reported, give rise to different clinical manifestations as claimed on the basis of which we validate the presence of diverse strains of SARS-CoV-2.",Published online 2020 Oct 8.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started as an epidemic in Wuhan in 2019, and has since become a pandemic. Groups from China identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and determined that it was a novel coronavirus sharing high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has enabled the development of diagnostic tools. Additionally, serological tests can now identify individuals who have been infected. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a fatality rate of around 1–3%, which is commonly linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely resulting from uncontrolled immune activation, the so called “cytokine storm”. Risk factors for mortality include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatments for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase III. Better knowledge of the virus and its enzymes will aid the development of more potent and specific direct-acting antivirals. In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection is crucial; however, even if successful, it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, except for intravenous remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort."

It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates."

Being primarily a respiratory disease, it is highly transmissible through both direct and indirect contacts. It displays a range of symptoms in different individuals and thus has been grouped into mild, moderate, and severe diseases. The virus utilizes spike proteins present on its surface to recognize ACE-2 receptors present on the host cells to enter the cell cytoplasm and replicate. The viral invasion of cells induces damage response, pyroptosis, infiltration of immune cells, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and activation of the adaptive immune system. Depending on viral load and host factors like age and underlying medical conditions, the immune responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death. In this review, we specify and justify both viral and host therapeutic targets that can be modulated to relieve the symptoms and treat the disease. Furthermore, we discuss vaccine development in the time of pandemic and the most promising vaccine candidates by far, according to WHO database. Finally, we discuss the conventional re-purposed drugs and potential alternative treatments as adjuvants."

Thus, in this review, we summarized the main diagnostic approaches currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans based on studies available in article databases. The tests can be organized into two main categories: nucleic acid-based tests, recommended for the initial detection of the virus, and serological tests, recommended for assessing the disease progression. The studies have shown that the performance of diagnostic methods depends on different factors, such as the type of samples and the characteristics of each assay. It was identified that the positivity of the tests is mainly related to the onset of symptoms. We also observed that point-of-care diagnoses are considered as one of the main trends in this area, due to the low-cost and simplicity of the assay; however, the analytical performance must be critically analyzed.

Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the virus’s pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity.

Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry.

Thanks to the still fairly recent experience gained from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Chinese scientists and clinicians worked together and quickly identified a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the pathogen (Zhou et al., 2020b). A complete lock-down and other quarantine measures (e.g., staying at home, social distancing, wearing mask and gloves, hand washing, etc.) were implemented initially in Wuhan City and then across much of China in the midst of its busy Chinese New Year holiday season. While the outbreak was brought under control in China quite promptly, the virus has quickly spread across the globe, causing significant morbidity and mortality initially in Italy, then other European countries, United States (US), Brazil and the rest of the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. On March 13th, the US government declared a National Emergency. In the US, the New York City-New Jersey area was the epicenter from March to May. By the end of June, COVID-19 resurgence occurred in its Sun Belt States including Arizona, Texas, and Florida, which became the new epicenter. On July 17, the US set a new record of over 77,255 new cases and the world saw over 260,000 new cases in a single day. As of October 19, 2020, there were over 40 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 1.1 million deaths worldwide, affecting 189 countries and territories [Fig. 1 , (Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html].",Published online 2020 Nov 27.,"Several studies have attempted to investigate the presence of COVID-19 in semen of infected or recovering men, showing conflicting results (Table 1) [42, 61, 62, 68, 69, 71, 72]. Most of these studies suggested it is highly unlikely that the COVID-19 can be sexually transmitted by men. Song et al. [68] examined semen samples of 12 recovering men and one testis tissue sample from a deceased patient. Both the semen and testis specimen were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA [68]. Guo et al. [62] reported no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen samples of 23 patients with a recent infection or recovering from COVID-19. The median interval from the diagnosis to providing the sample was 32 days [62]. Similar results were reported by Pan et al. in 34 recovering male patients [42]. In another study, no viral RNA was detected in semen samples obtained from recovered men (n = 18) 8–54 days after absence of symptoms, nor from 2 patients with acute COVID-19 infection [61]. A different study included semen samples from 16 hospitalized male patients taken during the acute stage of disease, and all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR [69]. Zhang et al. examined expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) in 10 male patients with confirmed COVID-19 (3 positive, 7 recovering). None of the patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in EPS [70]. Only one study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can be present and detected in the semen samples. 26.7% (4/15) of the patients who were in the acute stage of infection (6–11 days from onset of symptoms) and 8.7% of the patients (2/23) who were recovering (2–3 days after achieving clinical recovery) had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 in semen [71]. However, there is still no definitive data to prove that spermatozoa serve as vectors for sexual transmission of COVID-19. The conflicting findings regarding the presence of this virus in semen are based on studies with small sample sizes with proven COVID-19 infection, in both acute and recovery phase of the disease with limited data on severity of the disease, the methods for sample collection and contamination control. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR methods used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the semen were not reported. Overall, evidence suggests low detection (3.9%, 6/152) of the virus in semen. However, the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence in semen of men who unknowingly have the virus cannot be ruled out. This necessitates the need for further studies in symptomatic and asymptomatic men before any final conclusions can be drawn."

Coronaviruses are common in birds and mammals (with the greatest diversity in bats), and human infections are caused by two alpha- (i.e., HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and several beta- (e.g., HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) species [1]. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are also beta-coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are ubiquitous and along with rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, cause most community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections (i.e., the common cold) [2]. As with other respiratory viruses, coronaviruses occasionally cause more severe illness, with individuals at the extremes of age (i.e., infants and the elderly), as well as those with comorbid pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or immune compromising conditions (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant or HIV infection) at increased risk. Certain coronavirus species (e.g., HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) also are associated with more severe infection [3]. Except for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there has not been much interest in producing coronavirus vaccines. This derives from the fact that most coronaviruses: (1) cause mild, self-limiting illness; (2) are difficult to replicate in tissue culture; (3) display antigenic variation; and also (4) vaccine trials with at least one animal coronavirus demonstrated a worse outcome upon challenge with the virus (a problem similarly posed by dengue virus) [4]. Although some medicines, including antivirals and chloroquine, have demonstrated potent in vitro antiviral activity against tested coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43), randomized controlled clinical trials have not demonstrated efficacy and treatment is supportive.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand precisely the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this multifaceted disease. There is increasing evidence that the immune system reacts insufficiently to SARS-CoV-2 and thus contributes to organ damage and to lethality. In this review, we suggest that the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in oxidative stress is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage that leads to severe COVID-19. It increases the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppresses the adaptive arm of the immune system, i.e. T cells that are necessary to kill virus-infected cells. This creates a vicious cycle that prevents a specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The key role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 implies that therapeutic counterbalancing of ROS by antioxidants such as vitamin C or NAC and/or by antagonizing ROS production by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and neutrophil granulocytes and/or by blocking of TNF-α can prevent COVID-19 from becoming severe.

Overactivation of RAS has been implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, renovascular disorders, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, fibrosis, and sepsis [11, 12]. On the other hand, ACE2 which has considerable homology (40% identity and 61% similarity) to ACE metalloprotease [13, 14], functions as a negative regulator of the RAS system. Specifically, ACE2 reduces ANGII levels by cleaving it to the sorter ANG(1–7) peptide, which can then activate the vasodilation-promoting and anti-inflammatory MAS receptor (MASR) (Fig. 1) [15]. Furthermore, it has been reported that ACE2 links amino acid malnutrition to intestinal inflammation, as it is a key regulator of innate immunity, dietary amino acid homeostasis and gut microbial ecology [16]. Overall, the balance between the ACE/ANGII/AT1R and the opposing ACE2/ANG(1–7)/MASR axes is central in (among others) the physiological regulation of cardiovascular, blood pressure, neural and kidney functions [10, 12, 15].",Published online 2020 Nov 10.,

In particular, thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 are common and contribute to organ failure and mortality. Patients with severe COVID-19 present with hemostatic abnormalities that mimic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy associated with sepsis, with the major difference being increased risk of thrombosis rather than bleeding. However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection alters platelet function to contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unknown. In this study, we report altered platelet gene expression and functional responses in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. RNA sequencing demonstrated distinct changes in the gene-expression profile of circulating platelets of COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis revealed differential gene-expression changes in pathways associated with protein ubiquitination, antigen presentation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 binding, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was not detected by messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein in platelets. Surprisingly, mRNA from the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene was detected in platelets from 2 of 25 COVID-19 patients, suggesting that platelets may take-up SARS-COV-2 mRNA independent of ACE2. Resting platelets from COVID-19 patients had increased P-selectin expression basally and upon activation. Circulating platelet-neutrophil, -monocyte, and -T-cell aggregates were all significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, platelets from COVID-19 patients aggregated faster and showed increased spreading on both fibrinogen and collagen. The increase in platelet activation and aggregation could partially be attributed to increased MAPK pathway activation and thromboxane generation. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity, which may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology."

The novel strain was first identified in December 2019 (Bittmann et al., 2020), and it is the seventh coronavirus strain that has been reported to infect Homo sapiens (Poduri et al., 2020). During the writing of this manuscript, Covid-19 has led to the mortality of 1, 453,355 as of November 30, 2020 (https://covid19.who.int/). SARS-CoV-2 infects the lower respiratory system like that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and cause viral pneumonia. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also affect the kidney, liver, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal system leading to multiple organ failure (Su et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2020). Apart from lungs, Cardiovascular complications are recently seen as a new threat in Covid-19 along with blood clotting incidences (Escher et al., 2020; Varga et al., 2020). Further, the epidemiological data confirm that Covid-19 mortality is higher in men than in women attributed via significant role mediated by androgens (Goren et al., 2020; Sharifi and Ryan, 2020). Some studies have also highlighted the role of ABO system with the severity of Covid-19 suggesting A+ /AB system are more infected (Latz et al., 2020). The speedy spread of the disease and the mortality associated has caused havoc among humans all over the Globe, which has further worsened with the unavailability of some putative chemical bullets in forms of drugs and biologics (Pillaiyar et al., 2020; Xu and Dang, 2020). Covid-19 is now being considered as the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular diseases (Balakumar et al., 2016). The current scenario has led to the rapid repurposing of drugs for this pandemic. A data insight at Clinical Trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) informed that 2427 trials are being conducted around the Globe to find a putative lead. The data suggested that among all the studies, 25 studies are undergoing at preclinical phase, 141 in Phase 1, 539 in Phase 2, 327 in Phase 3, and 71 in Phase 4. Further data also suggested that among all the studies 182 have been completed, 1421 are either Ongoing/Recruiting/Active, not recruiting/Enrolling by invitation, whereas 41 have been either suspended/terminated or have withdrawn status, while remaining have unknown status. However, no apparent success has been seen so far. So, it is imperative to recognize the target to get high target specificity drugs that may be existing or designing new drug molecules to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previously, during the pandemic of SARS-CoV and MERS various drugs including hydroxychloroquine (Zhou et al., 2020), nitazoxanide (Rossignol, 2016), terconazole (Omrani and Memish, 2015), ritonavir (Chan et al., 2015), homoharringtonine (Mustafa et al., 2018), lopinavir (Chan et al., 2015), ribavirin (Khalili et al., 2020), emetine (Sharif-Yakan and Kanj, 2014), and many more were repurposed using various methodologies.

Tissue lesions can be caused by the pathogen or can be driven by an overwhelmed immune response. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2, we and others have observed that this virus can trigger indeed an immune response that can be dysregulated in severe patients and leading to further injury to multiple organs. The purpose of the review is to bring to light the current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 virologic and immunologic features. Thus, we address virus biology, life cycle, tropism for many organs and how ultimately it will affect several host biological and physiological functions, notably the immune response. Given that therapeutic avenues are now highly warranted, we also discuss the immunotherapies available to manage the infection and the clinical outcomes."

Here we analyze the laboratory findings of 1,850 patients to describe the dynamic changes of the total antibody, spike protein (S)-, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. The generation of S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG occurs one week later in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 compared to patients with mild/moderate disease, while S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during hospitalization. The RBD-specific IgG levels are 4-fold higher in older patients than in younger patients during hospitalization. In addition, the S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in the recovered patients who are SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative than those who are RNA positive. Lower S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG levels are associated with a lower lymphocyte percentage, higher neutrophil percentage, and a longer duration of viral shedding. Patients with low antibody levels on discharge might thereby have a high chance of being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery. Our study provides important information for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development."

In mild COVID-19 cases, patients have not only an early and robust IFN response and highly functional innate response but also a strong, multifaceted adaptive immune response to manage and clear the viral infection (Figure
1D). Virus-specific antibodies generated by plasma B cells and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes are educated by activated DCs draining from the lung to nearby LNs. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are found in plasma of patients and have strong affinity to the RBD of S protein, inhibiting ACE2 binding.49 Antibodies with specificity to N protein are also detected, and IgA, IgG, and IgM classes of antibodies were found,50 similar to anti-RBD antibodies.51 Clinically, a large proportion of the infiltrating adaptive immune cells is T cells, where both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a critical role. CD4+ T cells promote B cell activation and immune cell recruitment through cytokine production and are essential for production of neutralizing antibodies. CD8+ T cells are recruited to the airways to trigger apoptosis of infected cells (Figure
1E). Collectively, through robust neutralizing antibody and diverse T cell responses, a proper host immune system is able to clear the SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop robust serological and mucosal immune memory. Recent studies reveal the robust formation of B and T cell memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating the potential for long-term protection from future infections despite decay in neutralizing antibody titers.52,53 Detailed clinical studies are needed to investigate whether memory B and T cells are able to protect against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and prevent severe pathology in the absence of an acute humoral response. Interestingly, computerized tomography (CT) scans of COVID-19 infected patients showed temporal changes and ground glass opacification in the lungs regardless of disease severity,49 indicating broad pathological impacts even in asymptomatic patients and implying untold long-term implications that may extend past recovery from infection.54"

In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19.

The virus first enters the upper respiratory tract (nasal, pharynx) in the initial days of infection where ACE2 acts as a keyhole for the entry of pathogens. After entering the host cell, the virus releases its RNA genome inside the nucleus and the replication starts in the lower respiratory tract that leads to viremia. This condition can be easily cured because the patients are asymptomatic during this stage [12]. At this stage, the dendritic cells, macrophages, and respiratory epithelial cells secrete cytokines and chemokines to produce immune responses, to clear out the pathogen from the body. However, in further stages, the severity of infection increases as soon as the inflammatory pathways get activated and lead to cytokine storm or cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) [18].

Thus far, only a couple of them and not consistently across reports have been shown to further decrease mortality, respect to what can be achieved with supportive care. In most cases, and due to the urgency imposed by the number and severity of the patients’ clinical conditions, the choice of treatment has been limited to repurposed drugs, approved for other indications, or investigational agents used for other viral infections often rendered available on a compassionate-use basis. The rationale for drug selection was mainly, though not exclusively, based either i) on the activity against other coronaviruses or RNA viruses in order to potentially hamper viral entry and replication in the epithelial cells of the airways, and/or ii) on the ability to modulate the excessive inflammatory reaction deriving from dysregulated host immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2. In several months, an exceptionally large number of clinical trials have been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-COVID-19 therapies in different clinical settings (treatment or pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis) and levels of disease severity, but only few of them have been completed so far. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of action that have provided the scientific rationale for the empirical use and evaluation in clinical trials of structurally different and often functionally unrelated drugs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."

However, the SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Despite some differences in the cytokine patterns, it seems that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS. Monocytes and macrophages may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways. SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress the anti-viral IFN response in monocytes and macrophages. Since macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) act as antigen presenting cells (APCs), the infection of these cells by SARS-CoV-2 impairs the adaptive immune responses against the virus. Upon infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they become infected resident macrophages, allowing viruses to spread through all organs and tissues. The SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and macrophages can produce large amounts of numerous types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to local tissue inflammation and a dangerous systemic inflammatory response called cytokine storm. Both local tissue inflammation and the cytokine storm play a fundamental role in the development of COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Here, we describe the monocytes and macrophage responses during severe coronavirus infections, while highlighting potential therapeutic interventions to attenuate macrophage-related inflammatory reactions in possible approaches for COVID-19 treatment."

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the Coronaviridae family and are an important group of viruses that infect a large number of animals including mammalian and avian species.1 The Coronavirinae subfamily is divided into four genera based on genetic features: Alphacoronavirus (α-CoVs), Betacoronavirus (β-CoVs), Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoVs), and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoVs).

In this context, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme important in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), scarcely present in the circulation, but widely expressed in organs and able to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance, has been seen to play a key role (15, 16). ACE2 operates as an ACE counterpart: it acts as a carboxypeptidase, removing single amino acids, converting Ang II to its metabolite angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang1–7), balancing the effects of Ang II. ACE2 is found to the apical surface of epithelial cells, differently from ACE, which is located between the apical and basolateral membranes in polarized cells. ACE2 plays its pivotal role in regulating blood pressure and consequently hypertension. This activity is mediated by the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis, through which the regulation of angiotensin and Ang-(1–7) and nitric oxide (NO) availability control blood pressure alterations, which cause damages to vascular tissue as atherosclerosis, hypertrophy and more in general, endothelial alterations (17). Operatively, there are two forms of ACE2: (1) the full-length ACE2, that presents a structural transmembrane domain able to anchor its extracellular domain to the plasma membrane, and (2) the soluble form of ACE2, that lacks the membrane anchor and circulates in small amounts in the blood (15, 16). SARS-CoV-2 enters cell by the binding of spike (S) viral protein, an amino acid long protein that belongs to the viral envelope and leans outwards with a “corona” like form, to the ACE2 receptor (16, 18). The initial step of viral entry is represented by the binding of the N-terminal domain of the viral protein unit S1 to a pocket of the ACE2 receptor. After this, the receptor transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a member of the Hepsin/TMPRSS subfamily that is stechiometrically contiguous to ACE2 receptor, induces the cleavage of the protein between the S1 and S2 units, with the help of Furin which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding (19, 20). Furin [also termed paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE)], a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family that processes protein of the secretory pathway, is expressed in multiple organs, such as in lungs, liver, and small intestines. Following the binding of the S glycoprotein to ACE2, furin-mediated proteolytic cut of the S protein is necessary for viral entry into the cell (18, 21). Thus, both TMPRSS2 and Furin are crucial for S activation. The key role of these two proteases was also demonstrated by a recent study that showed that multicycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 human airway cells was strongly suppressed by inhibiting TMPRSS2 and Furin activity (22). However, virtually, other human proteases, e.g., cathepsin L and B, elastase, trypsin and factor X, may be involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human cell and in the shedding of ACE2. A critical cell membrane protease involved in the endogenous shedding of ACE2 from membranes is the disintegrin metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), also known as tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) (23). While TMPRSS2 cleaves both ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, leading to membrane fusion and cellular uptake of the virus, ADAM17 acts directly and solely on ACE2 and leads to ACE2 shedding into the extracellular cellular space. Thus, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 may have opposite effects on ACE2 shedding. Evidences have shown that the expression of TMPRSS2 inhibits ADAM17-shedding of ACE2 (24). However, it is unclear how TMPRSS2 transcends ADAM17 to cleave ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",null,null

The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage.

[2,3]. Numerous patients with baffling pneumonia secondary to an unknown virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and later the virus was identified as a new beta coronavirus and officially recognized as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4,5]. On 11th February 2020, the WHO named this disease as “COVID-19,” and subsequently, on 11th March 2020, the WHO declared the “COVID-19” a pandemic [6]. Currently, the outbreak has spread globally with approximately 10 million confirmed cases, 0.5 million confirmed deaths, and 5 million total worldwide recoveries as of 30th June 2020. Numerous pieces of evidences suggest that person-to-person transmission is an expected path for spreading of COVID-19 infection; primarily occurs via direct interaction or via microdroplets propagated by coughing or sneezing from an infected COVID-19 individual [[7], [8], [9]]. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic or symptomatic to clinical conditions marked by respiratory distress to systemic effects of sepsis, shock, and multiple syndromes of organ failure [10]. The typical clinical highlights include headache, fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue, breathlessness [[7], [8], [9], [10]] and have a strong prognosis in general. A considerable number of COVID-19 cases, however, have progressed rapidly to severe forms, especially among older men with underlying diseases.

In this context, it is a rational strategy to investigate the repurposing of existing drugs to use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the meantime, the medical community is trialing several therapies that target various antiviral and immunomodulating mechanisms to use against the infection. There is no doubt that antiviral and supportive treatments are important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but anti-inflammatory therapy also plays a pivotal role in the management COVID-19 patients due to its ability to prevent further injury and organ damage or failure.

Immune cells like neutrophils, infiltrating monocytes, and macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Also, respiratory manifestations such as cough, sputum production and shortness of breath remain the most common symptoms, following fever or pneumonia.11 , 12 In a study with 102 COVID-19 patients, serum level of cytokines as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were indicators of disease severity, showing that high levels of proinflammatory cytokine storm were associated with more severe disease development.13 Some patients with COVID-19 had severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular conditions, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, or septic shock. These complications are related to the release of cytokines and hyperinflammation or “cytokine storm syndrome”14 (Fig. 1).

In early January 2020, they were confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), later named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as the causal virus of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thanks to its remarkable capacity for asymptomatic transmission, SARS-CoV-2 possesses ideal attributes to reach pandemic levels. Since the identification of the first case in China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread all over the world, with about four million confirmed cases to date (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). Compared with other major viral outbreaks in contemporary history, like the 2002–2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; 2012–ongoing), COVID-19 appears to have a lower case-fatality rate (CFR; 3–4%) but a significantly higher basic reproductive ratio (R0) (2.68, 95% confidence interval: 2.47–2.86) (74) (TABLE 1). The main reasons why COVID-19 spreads more efficiently than SARS and MERS are its higher level of transmissibility and the number of freely circulating asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers (3, 27). A large study of 44,672 patients with COVID-19 in China, published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), reported a CFR of 2.3% (61), which is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%) (14) (TABLE 1). Noteworthy, COVID-19 CFR is highly variable across the globe and increases substantially in people aged 60 and more, as observed in the Italian population. Relative susceptibility to symptomatic infection also increases with age (children are rarely infected), raising questions about the underlying biology of host responses in relation to age (73).",Published online 2021 Jan 1.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy."

In fact, SARS accounted for more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries, as recorded during the period November 2002–August 2003 [5]. On the other hand, in 2012, MERS infection resulted in 2494 positive cases and 858 mortality cases [6]. The latest reports regarding COVID-19 revealed that the total cases as of May 16, 2020 are 4.56 million infections and 300,441 deaths worldwide [7]. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 gain cellular entry through the binding of their spike proteins to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) [8]. However, the pandemic pattern of COVID-19 can be attributed to the higher binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 [9]. To date, the morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 are ascending with no curative therapeutic approach against the virus yet. The major contributor to COVID-19 associated fatality rates is the respiratory complications, as the lungs appear to be the most sensitive organ for this virus [10]. The reason for this sensitivity is explained by the fact that the alveolar epithelial type-II cells are rich with ACE-2. ACE-2 is a membrane-bound enzyme and a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It has a pivotal role in protecting the lungs against many of the acute respiratory injuries [11], by mediating the proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation of the lung tissue [12].",null,null

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19."

Some studies suggest that COVID‐19 could be an immune‐related disease, and failure of effective immune responses in initial stages of viral infection could contribute to systemic inflammation and tissue damage, leading to worse disease outcomes. T cells can act as a double‐edge sword with both pro‐ and anti‐roles in the progression of COVID‐19. Thus, better understanding of their roles in immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is crucial. T cells primarily react to the spike protein on the coronavirus to initiate antiviral immunity; however, T‐cell responses can be suboptimal, impaired or excessive in severe COVID‐19 patients. This review focuses on the multifaceted roles of T cells in COVID‐19 pathogenesis and rationalizes their significance in eliciting appropriate antiviral immune responses in COVID‐19 patients and unexposed individuals. In addition, we summarize the potential therapeutic approaches related to T cells to treat COVID‐19 patients.

The etiological agent was isolated and its genome sequenced, which was found to be an emergent zoonotic virus, member of the Coronaviridae family, genetically related, but not a direct descendent, of another emergent coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Zhou et al. 2020a; Zhu et al. 2020b). The novel emergent virus named SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a rapid human-to-human spreading via the respiratory tract, and is responsible of a syndrome known as Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (Mahase 2020a). Since its discovery, COVID-19 has become a pandemic outbreak with more than 72.196 million people tested positive for the virus, which has resulted in more than 1.6 million deaths around the world by mid-December 2020 (CRC 2020). According to information displayed on the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Dashboard, even in countries where the number of daily cases has dropped (e.g., China, Australia), it is not possible to say that the virus has disappeared since active cases are still reported daily. For instance, in regions such as Europe and North America, and coinciding with the autumn and winter seasons, a dramatic increase in the number of reported cases has forced some countries (e.g. Italy, France, Germany) to tighten sanitary restrictions. However, in countries where the situation has improved (e.g. Chile), broad continuous testing, surveillance and contact tracing are still active. The SARS-CoV-2 infection clinical manifestation is complex; varying from asymptomatic or mild symptoms in more than 80% of carrier individuals, to severe respiratory and systemic distress, including obstructive pneumonia, hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, coagulopathies, neurocardiovascular disorders, and death. The mortality rate range from 1 to 3% among symptomatic patients, depending on medical infrastructure and early medical intervention (Connors and Levy 2020; Gupta et al. 2020a; Liu et al. 2020a; Marietta et al. 2020; Pelaia et al. 2020; Saha et al. 2020).

Pulmonary inflammation with substantial lung damage together with generalized immune dysregulation are major components of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The former component, lung damage, seems to be at least in part a consequence of immune dysregulation. Indeed, studies have revealed that immune alteration is not merely an association, as it might occur in systemic infections, but, very likely, the core pathogenic element of COVID-19. In addition, precise management of immune response in COVID-19, i.e. enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.

In this work, we have reviewed the most recent scientific evidence to provide a comprehensive panorama regarding the biotechnological strategies that have been proposed to combat this new viral infection. We have focused our analysis on vaccine production, nanotechnology applications, repurposing of know drugs for unrelated pathologies, and the search for bioactive molecules obtained from natural products. The goals include safely use as potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments, based on in silico and in vivo studies, including clinical trials around the world for the correct and timely diagnosis of the infection. This review aims to highlight the development of new ideas that can decrease the time lines for research output and improve research quality while at the same time, keeping in mind the efficacy and safety aspects of these potential biotechnological strategies."

The COVID-19 clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic individuals or mild flu-like symptoms, to a very severe condition with interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2]. In the first phases of the disease, the viral infection triggers a strong immune response which is fundamental for viral clearance, with a cascade of events involving both innate and adaptive immunity that potentially can become harmful when they become dysregulated [3,4]. The immunological alterations associated with different stages of COVID-19 have been described since the earliest reports, and include an elevated number of macrophages, hyperactivation of T cells and the release of increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα), leading to what is termed as “a cytokine storm” and cytokine release syndrome that appears to be correlated with the severity of disease outcome [5] possibly modifiable with immunomodulating drugs [6].

On 1 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) activated its incident management support team after the notification of the first cases, followed by an official publication on 5 January 2020. On 22 January 2020, the first COVID-19 case outside China was reported. The WHO gave their first public remark about the emergence of the COVID-19 disease on 4 February 2020, to present some preliminary results, with 20,471 cases in China and 425 deaths (99% of all cases reported), and to warn the world about the onset of a global pandemic. At that stage, there were only 176 cases reported outside China [6]. On 10 February 2020, more information about the mortality was released, with a rate of 2%, suggesting that, if the virus can infect rapidly, it could have a severe effect on the number of deaths. On 11 February, the WHO presented a series of questions that needed to be addressed to respond to the pandemic. On 17 February, more data was made available on population risk factors, such as age and pre-existing conditions. On 14 February, more information was reported about the non-significant change of the genetic makeup of the virus and the recovery time of patients. However, there was a sudden increase of cases in the world, including in Italy, Iran, and the Republic of Korea. For the first time, there were serious concerns of a pandemic in progress. On 27 February, there were cases reported in 44 countries, in all continents, and the WHO recommended that all countries make efforts to detect the virus early. More than 20 vaccines, and other therapeutic approaches, started to be tested in clinical trials. On 3 March 2020, it was reported that 1% of the cases did not have symptoms, suggesting that the infection could be more challenging to contain without rapid diagnostic methods. At this stage, the death rate comparison between seasonal flu (influenza) and COVID-19 was a factor of three, with a 3.4% death rate for COVID-19. On 4 March, the first signs of community transmission appeared in some countries. A month later, in the first public report from the WHO about COVID-19, the number of reported cases reached 100,000, exhibiting exponential growth [6]; thus, research priorities were listed, including the natural history of the virus, epidemiology, vaccines, diagnostics, treatments, clinical management, ethical considerations, and social sciences. The rapid progression of the virus suggested that medical devices and therapeutics would be essential to manage the number of patients arriving at hospitals. By 13 March, more than 100 countries reported cases of COVID-19, with an increase by a factor of thirteen outside of China, and almost 5000 deaths worldwide, which concluded that COVID-19 could be considered a pandemic. The WHO stressed the need to detect, prevent, and treat COVID-19 through innovation. At that time, it was reported that the pandemic center shifted from China to Europe, and more than 80% of the total active cases were reported from Western Pacific and Europe due to the escalating epidemic. The first vaccine (mRNA1273) clinical trial in the USA started less than 60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus had been made public on 27 February 2020. By 25 March, the WHO reported an increase of funding for diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. On 26 March, the results of the pandemic expansion showed that it took 67 days for the first 100,000 COVID-19 infected cases to be reported compared to 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, 4 days for the third 100,000 cases, and only 2 days for the fourth 100,000 cases, highlighting the exponential growth of the pandemic [6]. On 3 April 2020, more than 1 million cases and 50,000 deaths were reported worldwide. The fatality rate is estimated to be 10 times higher than that of influenza. By 16 April, the number of cases and deaths doubled within only 2 weeks, and 40,000 deaths were numbered within a single week. Four months later, more than 18 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported, including more than half a million deaths, and it continued to climb higher.

The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles.

The review presents the structures, mechanisms, and reported results of clinical trials of potential therapeutics that have been listed in clinicaltrials.gov. Given the fact that some of these therapeutics are multi-acting molecules, other relevant mechanisms will also be described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules and macromolecules of sulfated polysaccharides, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. The potential therapeutics target viral and/or host proteins or processes that facilitate the early stage of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral spike protein, the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the host transmembrane protease serine 2, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis process.

Still, among others, the corona- and influenza viruses undoubtedly cause more serious symptoms. Indeed, some of the most serious and prolonged historical and current infection outbreaks are associated with these viruses which have affected a large population, but especially older individuals [21]. The word “Pandemic” has been taken from Greek and means “of all the people”—it typically refers to the widespread emergence of a disease over one or several regions of the world [22], while the local occurrence of infections is called an epidemic, which is often driven by seasonal strains of viruses. Typically, pandemics may arise when novel strains of viruses infect humans and promote human-to-human transmission before humans develop appreciable immunity to fight against these strains.

Subsequently, on 11 February 2020, the world health organization (WHO) identified it as the new coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and it was declared as pandemic on 13 March 2020 [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen]. The public health professionals have discovered that this new pathogen possesses about 80% similarity to the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and therefore, given the name as SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020; Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 has not only aroused severe health issues around the world but has led to an un-precedented socio-economic burden. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of spreading among humans to humans from the infected individuals, bearing no or mild symptoms (Bai et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020). In the beginning, the diagnosis of patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection was done through the computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and was compared to the healthy lungs, varying opacities in the CT images were recorded in patients, leading to initial diagnosis of pneumonia (Li and Xia, 2020; Bernheim et al., 2020).

It had been 17 years since SARS again reappeared in China and within a very short interval, the situation had escalated beyond limits. By the time the global outbreak was confined, the virus had spread to over 8,000 people worldwide and killed almost 800 (Web Reference 1, Jan. 2020). The new SARS-like respiratory illness that emerged in China is caused by a coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). Illness caused by this virus is known as COVID-19 (Velavan and Meyer, 2020), which manifests with some routine symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Though presently there are no explicit antiviral treatment or vaccine approved for the disease, clinical trials are currently underway as the spread of the disease becomes uncontrollable. The outbreak of this illness has already surpassed SARS and is expected to grow even more (Web Reference 2, Mar. 2020). As the world races to ramp up testing for this pandemic, various technologies, and tactics are rolling out to make it easier and quicker for people to know whether they have been infected or not. In search of faster and cheaper tests, numerous diagnostics and pharmaceutical companies are working extensively (Web Reference 3, Feb. 2020). Several new detection techniques have been deployed by various organizations and they are ready to ship their products worldwide (Web Reference 4, Feb. 2020). These employ advanced and futuristic strategies that are likely to validate the diagnosis in a shorter period with high precision. The diagnostic spectrum of COVID-19 crucially involves sampling from the suspected patient as the preliminary step. In hospitals, such samples are obtained from the respiratory system specifically nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP) swab, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and sputum, which are then used to diagnose the virus infection (Holshue et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). This is because, just like the other CoV infections, detection of this virus in the respiratory tract samples is a major key for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (Huang et al., 2020).

There is a wide range for the severity of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic disease to severe respiratory failure and even death [1] (this article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review). COVID-19 clinical signs are categorized under three types. Type I includes asymptomatic carriers with or without detectable virus. Non-severe symptomatic infection with the presence of virus is regarded as type II. Type III is represented by severe respiratory disorder with high viral load [2] (this article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review). The three clinical types of the disease show different behavior of the virus in terms of the host’s immune system. Regardless of the disease type, immune system responds via initial innate and later adaptive responses. The resolving cases of the disease are representative of orchestrated innate and adaptive immune response. However, the damages in the non-resolving lethal cases are presumed to be due to inefficient and/or insufficient immune response.

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being “immune” to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them."

The reports indicate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to affect almost any organ due to the presence of a receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) across the body. ACE2 receptor is majorly expressed in the brush border of gut enterocytes along with the ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells in the lungs. The amino acid transport function of ACE2 has been linked to gut microbial ecology in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby suggesting that COVID-19 may, to some level, be linked to the enteric microbiota. The significant number of COVID-19 patients shows extra-pulmonary symptoms in the GI tract. Many subsequent studies revealed viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples of COVID-19 patients.

Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of smoking on the clinical manifestations, disease progression, inflammatory responses, immunopathogenesis, racial ethnic disparities, and incidence of COVID-19. This review also documents future directions of smoking related research in COVID-19. The current epidemiological finding suggests that active smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell and activate a ‘cytokine storm’ which can lead to worsen outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This receptor can also act as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on a legacy of inequalities regarding gender, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with active smoking, thus, smoking cessation may help in improving outcomes. In addition, to flatten the COVID-19 curve, staying indoors, avoiding unnecessary social contact, and bolstering the immune defense system by maintaining a healthy diet/living are highly desirable."

Several reports from around the world have identified obesity and severe obesity as one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, countries with greater obesity prevalence have a higher morbidity and mortality risk of developing serious outcomes from COVID-19. The understanding of how this increased susceptibility of the people with obesity to develop severe forms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs is crucial for implementing appropriate public health and therapeutic strategies to avoid COVID-19 severe symptoms and complications in people living with obesity. We hypothesize here that increased ACE2 expression in adipose tissue displayed by people with obesity may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and accessibility to this tissue. Individuals with obesity have increased white adipose tissue, which may act as a reservoir for a more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification. Here we discuss how obesity is related to a pro-inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation, increased SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry in adipose tissue and induction of hypercoagulopathy, leading people with obesity to develop severe forms of COVID-19 and also death. Taken together, it may be crucial to better explore the role of visceral adipose tissue in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate the potential therapeutic effect of using specific target anti-inflammatories (canakinumab or anakinra for IL-1β inhibition; anti-IL-6 antibodies for IL-6 inhibition), anticoagulant or anti-diabetic drugs in COVID-19 treatment of people with obesity.

The patients with mild symptoms generally recover after one week. However, in many cases it has progressed to severe life threatening or fatal conditions (Adhikari et al., 2020).

The control over the spread of the disease requires an efficient and scalable laboratory-based strategy for testing the population based on multiple platforms to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis. With the onset of the pandemic, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has become a standard diagnostic tool, which has received wide clinical use. In large-scale and repeated examinations, these tests can identify infected patients with COVID-19, with their accuracy, however, dependent on many factors, while the entire process takes up to 6–8 h. Here we also describe a number of serological systems for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These are used to assess the level of population immunity in various categories of people, as well as for retrospective diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in patients. However, the widespread use of traditional diagnostic tools in the context of the rapid spread of COVID-19 is hampered by a number of limitations. Therefore, the sharp increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 necessitates creation of new rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific tests. In this regard, we focus on new laboratory technologies such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), which have proven to work well in the COVID-19 diagnostics and can become a worthy alternative to traditional laboratory-based diagnostics resources. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system requires a combination of various types of laboratory diagnostic testing techniques, whodse sensitivity and specificity increases with the progress in the SARS-CoV-2 research.

The resulting COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020. By July 2020, COVID-19 was present in 213 countries and territories, with over 12 million confirmed cases and over half a million attributed deaths. Knowledge of other viral respiratory diseases suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be modulated by seasonally varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Many studies on the environmental sensitivity of COVID-19 are appearing online, and some have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Initially, these studies raised the hypothesis that climatic conditions would subdue the viral transmission rate in places entering the boreal summer, and that southern hemisphere countries would experience enhanced disease spread. For the latter, the COVID-19 peak would coincide with the peak of the influenza season, increasing misdiagnosis and placing an additional burden on health systems. In this review, we assess the evidence that environmental drivers are a significant factor in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, globally and regionally. We critically assessed 42 peer-reviewed and 80 preprint publications that met qualifying criteria. Since the disease has been prevalent for only half a year in the northern, and one-quarter of a year in the southern hemisphere, datasets capturing a full seasonal cycle in one locality are not yet available. Analyses based on space-for-time substitutions, i.e., using data from climatically distinct locations as a surrogate for seasonal progression, have been inconclusive. The reported studies present a strong northern bias. Socio-economic conditions peculiar to the ‘Global South’ have been omitted as confounding variables, thereby weakening evidence of environmental signals. We explore why research to date has failed to show convincing evidence for environmental modulation of COVID-19, and discuss directions for future research. We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests a weak modulation effect, currently overwhelmed by the scale and rate of the spread of COVID-19. Seasonally modulated transmission, if it exists, will be more evident in 2021 and subsequent years."

While there is no evidence for age-dependent differences of viral loads in COVID-19 patients, only a fraction of individuals exposed to the virus is infected and not all infected individuals develop the symptoms of COVID-19 (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). Similar to the two related viruses—SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—SARS-CoV-2 harnesses the widely expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells as an entry receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in three stages: an asymptomatic incubation period (with the potential, however, of transmission to susceptible individuals), a mildly symptomatic period in some patients, and, in ∼19% of confirmed cases, progression to a severely symptomatic state with 5% of critical disease courses (Rothe et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020). Inferring from the pathophysiology of other coronaviruses, it is very likely that the capacity to mount a protective adaptive immune response plays a decisive role if viral propagation can be stopped early or if the virus will massively destroy tissues with high ACE2 expression, ultimately leading to a severe inflammatory state with relevant organ damage, specifically in the lungs and the kidneys (McKechnie and Blish, 2020; Puelles et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Based on these assumptions, as long as no protective vaccine is available, antiviral and therapeutic approaches promoting adaptive immunity would seem to be the most promising early in the disease, whereas in later disease stages, it may be key to suppressing inflammation to prevent tissue damage. However, there is only incomplete knowledge about the nature of T and B cell immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the factors determining the regulation of such responses and their persistence. This is especially true for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients who achieved spontaneous viral clearance, thus providing a bottleneck resource for identifying successfully regulated anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses that are urgently needed to inform trial design and strategic vaccine development.",null,null

Severe cases of the virus frequently result in respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, often seen, but not confined to, individuals with pre-existing hypertension and cardiovascular disease, potentially due to the fact that the virus can enter the circulation via the lung alveoli. Here the virus can directly infect vascular tissues, via TMPRSS2 spike glycoprotein priming, thereby facilitating ACE-2-mediated viral entry.

Common symptoms of the infection include loss of taste and smell, dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and radiological manifestations of bilateral lung infiltration. On January 7, 2020, viral strains were successfully isolated from clinical samples. Through genome-wide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, researchers discovered that the viral genome is 89.1% similar to that of a coronavirus found in bats.1 Wu et al. then published the genome information on the novel coronavirus immediately on virological.org and the GenBank database.1,2 These platforms facilitate rapid information sharing, allowing scientists around the world to keep tracing the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which is now known as SARS-CoV-2. The epidemic has spread rapidly across the world with the first case reported internationally in Thailand on January 13, followed by Japan,3 South Korea,4 the United States,5 European countries,6 Australia,7 and other countries. To date, COVID-19 (official name for the novel coronavirus infection) has affected 213 countries with the United States leading the number of confirmed cases, and most recently, Africa is facing an acceleration in the rate of infection. On March 12, COVID-19 was listed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), the first since the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. It was the first time that a coronavirus infection has been assessed as a pandemic, surpassing the total count of the SARS outbreak in 2003.",Published online 2020 Aug 17.,"In this review, we address issues that relate to the rapid “Warp Speed” development of vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the antibody response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of humans and how it may inform vaccine research. The isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and humans and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus challenge experiments in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses are recombinant proteins, which were not included in the initial wave of Warp Speed immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccines. We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the Warp Speed vaccine program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse influence on vaccine uptake generally."

Timely and adequate treatment for COVID-19 requires the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the acute-care setting. The previous 2003 SARS epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)) and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (H1N1pdm09 virus) also indicated the importance of rapid diagnostics for decision-making with regard to medical triage, infection control, and patient treatment [4]. Regardless of the fact that the outcomes from infection rely on how quickly the pathogen is detected, however, hospital laboratories still remain conventional in their use of traditional, time-consuming, multistep methods such as culture-based assays to diagnose emerging and re-emerging diseases, which occasionally fail to satisfy the demand of the diagnosis in the acute and critical-care settings [5, 6].",Published online 2020 Jul 1.,"Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its clinical manifestations, and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4–6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease—mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40–80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2."

Classically, this functional aspect of the JAK/STAT pathway may be related to the cytokine receptor signaling. In unstimulated cells, the STAT proteins with SH2 domains are inactive and confined to the cytoplasm. Following cytokine receptor stimulation, STAT proteins bind to the phospho-tyrosine that contains sequences of the receptor, using SH2 domains [2]. Further, the JAK induced phosphorylation of STAT proteins at the cytokine type receptors causes subsequent dimerization of STAT proteins.

The study indicated that the course of COVID-19 is worse in pregnant women who are more often admitted to intensive care units or who require mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women with COVID-19. Some symptoms, such as dyspnea and cough, were similar to those observed in nonpregnant women, but fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, and diarrhea were less frequent. A study revealed that premature delivery and cesarean section were more common in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, recent studies confirm the possibility of intrauterine maternal–fetal transmission by positive genetic tests and the presence of IgM in newborns just after delivery; at the moment, the probability of transmission through mother’s milk is inconclusive.

Here, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a novel immunogenic secreted protein and utilized it for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA.

The official declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the WHO, the worldwide societal lockdown in an attempt to thwart the progression of the disease, and the vast number of lives affected all underline the dire need for a treatment or vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus implicated in COVID-19), as well as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (see Glossary) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belong to the Betacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family [5,6]. These viruses have a positive-sense RNA genome that in SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins and 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). The four structural proteins encoded are spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [7]. The structural proteins are largely responsible for receptor recognition on the host cell, membrane fusion, and subsequent viral entry. The NSPs are essential for replicative functions such as RNA polymerization by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, NSP12) [8]. The structural S protein forms homotrimers on the viral membrane in which each monomer is composed of two subunits – the N-terminal S1, that is largely responsible for receptor recognition, and the C-terminal S2, that is implicated in membrane fusion and viral entry (Figure 1 ). The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the region of the protein that makes direct contact with the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6]. Two conformations of RBD have been observed – 'down/closed' and 'up/open' – wherein the latter conformation reveals the full extent of the RBD that allows ACE2 binding [9,10]. The S2 subunit contains the fusion peptide (FP), the heptad repeat 1 (HR1), and heptad repeat 2 (HR2).",Published online 2020 Jul 13.,"In line with SARS and MERS, the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest challenges in medicine and health care worldwide.

Neither an antiviral nor an immunomodulatory therapy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 or pre-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 has proved to be effective. In this review, we try to close the gap and point out the likely relationships among lysosomotropism, increasing lysosomal pH, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and disease process, and we deduce an approach for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)/cytokine storm triggered by bacteria or viruses. Lysosomotropic compounds affect prominent inflammatory messengers (e.g., IL-1B, CCL4, CCL20, and IL-6), cathepsin-L-dependent viral entry of host cells, and products of lysosomal enzymes that promote endothelial stress response in systemic inflammation. As supported by recent clinical data, patients who have already taken lysosomotropic drugs for other pre-existing conditions likely benefit from this treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic. The early administration of a combination of antivirals such as remdesivir and lysosomotropic drugs, such as the antibiotics teicoplanin or dalbavancin, seems to be able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transition to COVID-19."

COVID-19 was officially announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11, 2020. So far there have been more than 7,823,289 cases confirmed globally, with 431,541 deaths from more than 210 countries and territories as of 15th June 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 is the virus strain that causes the respiratory illness COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses (Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2020b). It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with approximately 50–200 nm in diameter (Fig. 1 A) (Xu et al., 2020). Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mainly has four structural proteins, namely, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively (Wrapp et al., 2020). The virus makes full use of S protein to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the human cell surface, to gain entry into a host cell. The N protein holds the viral genome but also involves in the host cellular response to viral infection. S, E, and M proteins together create the viral outer protecting membrane (Fig. 1B) (Wrapp et al., 2020). Both proteins (e.g. S protein) and viral RNA can be used as targets for COVID-19 detection. Alternatively, antibodies such as IgM and IgG from patient samples could also be detected for understanding the infection history. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable 2–3 days before onset of symptoms and can remain up to 25–50 days afterwards, depending on disease severity (He et al., 2020). Many studies show IgM antibodies start to be detectable around 5–10 days after onset of symptoms and rise rapidly, followed by IgG antibody response closely (Peeling et al., 2020). These seroconversions are typically within the first 3 weeks with the mean time of 9–11 days after onset of symptoms for total antibodies (10–12 days for IgM and 12–14 days for IgG). RNA level can remain high despite high concentrations of IgM and IgG antibodies in patient blood (Zhao et al., 2020). These viral infection and immune response studies highlight the detection window for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and more importantly, guide the strategic implementation of appropriate types of testing at different infection stages. For example, immune testing can play a big role in tracing symptomatic cases at the middle/late stage of the infection (e.g. 5–10 days after symptom onset). IgM positive result in symptomatic patients fulfilling the COVID-19 case definition is strongly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, RNA testing is still recommended for confirming the case.",null,null

Viral pathogens are known to cause outbreaks that have epidemic and pandemic potential. Several factors underlie the emergence of such diseases, including increasing population, increased domestic and global connectivity, social practices, prevalence of immunosuppressive diseases, change in agricultural practices such as mixed farming, and many other related environmental factors 1. Climate changes and reduction in biodiversity may play a role by forcing species to change geographical range and to survive in seminatural habitats that may bring wild animals closer to humans 2. Disturbance of natural ecosystems is reported to increase the transfer of disease from wild species to humans and is suggested to increase occurrences of neglected, forgotten and new human diseases 3. It is well known that pathogen genomics vary considerably, thus, occurring genetic alterations have also been responsible for such outbreaks 4. Although humanity has made meaningful progress in the battle against pathogens, the re-emergence of viral agents remains a great threat and challenge for the global health community 5. About 60% of infectious diseases and 70% of emerging infections of humans are zoonotic in origin, with two-thirds originating in wildlife 6. Over the last decades, several viral diseases had emerged in China, namely, those caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome- (SARS-) coronavirus (CoV) and the H5N1, H1N1, and H7N9 viruses 7. Recently, near the end of 2019, an outbreak of an ongoing viral pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. The infectious agent of this viral pneumonia was identified as the 7th member of human coronaviruses (2019-nCoV) 8. On 11th February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel viral pneumonia “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19), while the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) suggested this novel coronavirus will be named “SARS-CoV-2” due to the phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis of this novel coronavirus 9. The SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. COVID-19 is characterized by a high infectivity during incubation and a time delay between really infected cases and daily observed number of confirmed cases 10. The novel coronavirus is believed to be infectious during its incubation period, which is reported to be 3-7 days, at most 14 days, when no symptoms are shown in patients 11. Environmental factors, particularly weather conditions, are suspected to favor emergence and spread of the outbreak. Both drought and cold, which characterized the 2019 winter in Wuhan 12, provided conducive environmental conditions for virus survival 13,14. During the cold winter, air-dried virus particles are a dangerous form of virus, which survive for a long period of time in airflow 15.

However, in some patients COVID-19 leads to severe pneumonia and sepsis with subsequent respiratory failure and gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, and cardiovascular complications. A higher risk of infection is intrinsic to active rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and the use of biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). With an increasing number of reports on COVID-19 in RMD patients, we are beginning to appraise their risks. In this review, we summarize the published cases of COVID-19 infections in RMD patients, including patients with inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases as well as anti-phospholipid syndrome and Kawasaki syndrome. Overall, patients with inflammatory arthritis do not seem to be at a higher risk for infection or a severe course of COVID-19. Risk for critical COVID-19 in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as SLE or vasculitis might be increased, but this needs further confirmation. Furthermore, we summarize the data on DMARDs used to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperinflammation."

A model that accounts for the molecular players involved as well as the timing and localization of events throughout the viral replication cycle will aid in the rational design of novel drugs, the repurposing of existing drugs, and the development of combinatorial therapies (Figure
2). Given the initial successes of host–pathogen interaction mapping in standard, though less physiologically relevant cell lines like HEK293T cells, it is imperative to expand these efforts to clinically relevant cell models that mimic the infection in human lung epithelia. While expression of individual affinity-tagged viral proteins allows high-throughput discovery of stable virus–host interactions, this approach will miss highly transient or less stable interactions, as well as those interactions that rely on simultaneous expression of multiple viral proteins, such as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme responsible for viral genome replication. Therefore, host–pathogen interaction studies should be performed in the context of viral infection. In addition, cross-linking coupled with AP-MS, or the application of global XL-MS experiments, can capture transient and weaker interactions from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (see XL-MS section above). These experiments can provide PPI network data and inform virus–host protein complex structures. Furthermore, exciting work could be done to investigate not only SARS-CoV-2, but other human coronaviruses (i.e., HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV) in reservoir and cell lines from cross-species, such as bats. Through identification of conserved virus–host interactions across different coronavirus species, host factors that increase or mitigate pathogenicity, severity, infectivity, and cross-species barriers could be identified. These data would be a starting point for designing pan-coronavirus treatment strategies."

Since the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, millions of cases have been diagnosed worldwide resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. With no current effective therapy or vaccine for COVID-19, the enormous number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 is likely to continue to increase. In this regard, although the adverse effects of COVID-19 were initially considered to primarily affect the respiratory tract by causing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it has now become apparent that COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state, which can manifest as microvascular thrombosis, venous, or arterial thrombosis, the presence of which usually portends an adverse prognosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 induces a prothrombotic state to develop effective therapeutic approaches for COVID-19-associated thrombosis. This review will detail the significant emerging clinical findings of the prothrombotic status of patients suffering from COVID-19. We then provide an overview of the inherent links between the immune response and thrombosis, and how these mechanisms may help explain the prothrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we will use this data to explore available therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Given the relative lack of data to date demonstrating the precise mechanisms of the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, thrombosis, and clinical outcomes, we also highlight experimental data from other viral infections and thromboinflammatory disorders that are likely relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research is urgently required to clearly define how SARS-CoV-2 infection results in thrombotic complications and how this impacts the disease course and severity.

The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV-1). Both coronaviruses also share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) one. In spite of these similarities, the new coronavirus has expanded more widely, more faster and more lethally than the previous one. Many researchers across the disciplines have used diverse modeling tools to analyze the impact of this pandemic at global and local scales. This includes a wide range of approaches – deterministic, data-driven, stochastic, agent-based, and their combinations – to forecast the progression of the epidemic as well as the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop or mitigate its impact on the world population. The physical complexities of modern society need to be captured by these models. This includes the many ways of social contacts – (multiplex) social contact networks, (multilayers) transport systems, metapopulations, etc. – that may act as a framework for the virus propagation. But modeling not only plays a fundamental role in analyzing and forecasting epidemiological variables, but it also plays an important role in helping to find cures for the disease and in preventing contagion by means of new vaccines. The necessity for answering swiftly and effectively the questions: could existing drugs work against SARS CoV-2? and can new vaccines be developed in time? demands the use of physical modeling of proteins, protein-inhibitors interactions, virtual screening of drugs against virus targets, predicting immunogenicity of small peptides, modeling vaccinomics and vaccine design, to mention just a few. Here, we review these three main areas of modeling research against SARS CoV-2 and COVID-19: (1) epidemiology; (2) drug repurposing; and (3) vaccine design. Therefore, we compile the most relevant existing literature about modeling strategies against the virus to help modelers to navigate this fast-growing literature. We also keep an eye on future outbreaks, where the modelers can find the most relevant strategies used in an emergency situation as the current one to help in fighting future pandemics."

Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality. However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis. Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality. We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans. In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system. We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality. A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age. We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk. Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies."

Generally, lung damage is the main reason for the death of COVID-19 patients (Wu et al., 2020a, b, c, d).",Published online 2020 Apr 30.,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the greatest medical challenge in decades. We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) —a homologue of ACE—to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed."

Alternatively, the detection of antibodies within blood can be used for COVID-19 diagnosis. When infected by SARS-CoV-2, humans produce specific antibodies in fighting against COVID-19 along with immune cells. By detecting these identified antibodies, we can indirectly judge if a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the principle of specific binding of antigen and antibody. Antibodies for detection are mainly divided into two categories. IgM mainly occurs in the early stage of COVID-19, while IgG occurs at a later stage. At present, there are at least 23 commercial kits based on antibody/antigen available for testing.

Earlier outbreaks of coronavirus diseases that led to severe threats to human health at the beginning of the 21st century were caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and the MERS-CoV [25]. The natural reservoir for these viruses includes wild animals like bats, from which the virus may be transmitted to a secondary host and humans [26]. SARS-CoV-2 is 96 % similar to bat coronaviruses at the whole genome level [27]. Zhang et al. determined the probable pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2, which was 91.02 % similar to SARS-CoV-2 at the genome level [28]. COVID-19, an inflammatory viral disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a deadly disease emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China. A recent study identified the novel coronavirus by deep sequencing analysis of isolated human airway epithelial cells from patients with pneumonia, which was later named SARS-CoV-2 [29]. The initial events of virus spread was associated with animal-to-animal contact, and subsequent spread to humans was linked to the Huanan seafood market [30]. It has affected several countries across the globe with a wide community spread and high mortality. There are numerous clinical trials under way in developing potent vaccines and potential anti-viral and neutralizing therapies for COVID-19 [31]. The mortality of COVID-19 aggravates in patients with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and liver diseases. Besides chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of asthma worsens disease severity and increases mortality rate in COVID-19 patients [32,33]. The expression of ACE2 receptor is upregulated in the lung tissues of tobacco smokers, suggesting that smoking is a critical risk factor for viral infections [34].

In Japan, the first COVID-19 patient was identified on January 15, 2020. By June 30, the total number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 reached 18,000. The impact of molecular detection of pathogens is significant in acute-care settings where rapid and accurate diagnostic measures are critical for decisions in patient treatment and outcomes of infectious diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), are the most established gene amplification tools and have a comprehensive range of clinical applications, including detecting a variety of pathogens, even novel agents causing emerging infections. Because SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded RNA genome, reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) has been broadly employed for rapid and sensitive quantitative measurements of viral RNA copy numbers. The RT-qPCR method, however, still requires time-consuming reactions with two different enzymes in addition to isolation of RNA from patient samples, limiting the numbers of testing institutions for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Japan is known to have performed a relatively small number of PCR tests as well as confirmed cases among developed nations; as of June 30, 2020, approximately 390,000 people in Japan had undergone PCR tests. Given the devastating impact on medical services and the scale of demand for diagnostic testing of COVID-19, it has been proposed that academic settings such as basic research departments in university/college can be engaged in diagnosing, especially in university hospitals or academic medical centers. In collaboration with established diagnostic laboratories, academic facilities can divert their function to detecting virus from patients with suspected COVID-19, adopting existing specialized expertise in virus handling, molecular work, and data analysis. This in-house testing strategy facilitates the rapid diagnosing of thousands of samples per day and reduces sample turnaround time from 1 week to less than 24 h.

Inflammation being a significant influencer in COVID-19 patients, it drives our focus onto the signaling cascades of the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK phosphorylation mediated by cytokine receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of STATs that translocate into the nucleus to translate for inflammatory mediators. The SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins like spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins along with the non- structural proteins 1-16 including proteases like 3CL pro and PLpro promote its entry and survival in hosts. The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammation via the JAK/STAT pathway leading to recruitment of pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells progressing towards cytokine storm. This produces various inflammatory markers in the host that determine the disease severity. The JAK/STAT signaling also mediates immune responses via B cell and T cell differentiation.With an attempt to reduce excessive inflammation, JAK/STAT inhibitors like Ruxolitinib, Baricitinib, Tofacitinib have been employed that mediate its actions via suppressors of cytokine signaling, cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein, Protein inhibitor of activated STAT and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Even though they are implicated with multiple adverse effects, the regulatory authorities have supported its use, and numerous clinical trials are in progress to prove their safety and efficacy.

A major hypothesis that is currently guiding research and clinical care posits that an excessive and uncontrolled surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines (the so-called “cytokine storm”) drives morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases. In the overall efforts made to develop effective and safe therapies (including vaccines) for COVID-19, clinicians are thus repurposing ready-to-use drugs with direct or indirect anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Speculatively, there are many opportunities and challenges in targeting immune/inflammatory processes in the evolving settings of COVID-19 disease because of the need to safely balance the fight against virus and aggressive inflammation versus the suppression of host immune defenses and the risk of additional harms in already compromised patients. To this end, many studies are globally underway to weigh the pros and cons of tailoring drugs used for inflammatory-driven conditions to COVID-19 patient care, and the next step will be to summarize the growing clinical trial experience into clean clinical practice. Based on the current evidence, anti-inflammatory drugs should be considered as complementary approaches to anti-viral drugs that need to be timely introduced in the management of COVID-19 according to disease severity. While drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication are expected to confer the greatest benefits at the early stage of the infection, anti-inflammatory drugs would be more effective in limiting the inflammatory processes that drive the worsening of the disease."

Therefore, based on the fast and global spread of the virus, urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop preventive and therapeutic drugs. In this regard, treatments addressing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become a major focus. Notably, while a rapid and well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection, excessive inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive host immune defense may lead to tissue damage both at the site of virus entry and at systemic level. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients. In particular, the massive cytokine and chemokine release, the so-called “cytokine storm”, clearly reflects a widespread uncontrolled dysregulation of the host immune defense. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of signaling pathways altered during viral infections may help to unravel the most relevant molecular cascades implicated in biological processes mediating viral infections and to unveil key molecular players that may be targeted. Thus, given the key role of the immune system in COVID-19, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases and for preventing the transition from mild to severe stages."

Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications.

Since the report of the first case of COVID-19 having gastrointestinal (GI) complaints [4], additional reports have explored extra-pulmonary effects of the virus. Involvement of the pancreas secondary to viral infections is not uncommon. Commonly reported viruses affecting the pancreas include hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis A, B, E, Epstein Barr virus, coxsackie virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster virus, HIV, and viruses ceasing mumps, measles, and varicella-zoster. The mechanism of a viral infection causing pancreatic injury depends on the type of virus [5]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to affect the pancreas to varying degrees.",null,"COVID-19 has forsaken the world because of extremely high infection rates and high mortality rates. At present we have neither medicine nor vaccine to prevent this pandemic. Lockdowns, curfews, isolations, quarantines, and social distancing are the only ways to mitigate their infection. This is badly affecting the mental health of people. Hence, there is an urgent need to address this issue. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel Betacorona virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which has emerged in the city of Wuhan in China and declared a pandemic by WHO since it affected almost all the countries the world, infected 24,182,030 people and caused 825,798 death as per data are compiled from John Hopkins University (JHU). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive (+) sense RNA of ∼30 kb nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence similarity (∼79 %) with SARS-CoV. Envelope and nucleocapsids are two evolutionary conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 having a sequence identity of about 96 % and 89.6 %, respectively as compared to SARS-CoV. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Transmission of this virus in the human occurs through the respiratory tract and decreases the respiration efficiency of lungs. Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation period of 2–14 days. The virus first infects the lower airway and bind with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of alveolar epithelial cells. Due to the unavailability of drugs or vaccines, it is very urgent to design potential vaccines or drugs for COVID-19. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic play an important role in designing potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The suitable vaccine selects for SARS-CoV-2 based on binding energy between the target protein and the designed vaccine. The stability and activity of the designed vaccine can be estimated by using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. This review mainly focused on the brief up to date information about COVID-19, molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathways involved during COVID-19 infection. It also covers potential vaccine design against COVID-19 by using various computational approaches. SARS-CoV-2 enters brain tissue through the different pathway and harm human's brain and causes severe neurological disruption."

This suggested that the immune system through its memory keeping abilities might have remembered its previous encounter with SARS-CoV-2 and swung into action, preventing the re-infection before it could do much damage [1]. On the contrary, more severe symptoms of re-infection cases were reported by public-health workers in Nevada [2]. This had left scientist and researchers with the questions of the possibility of the immune system failing to protect against the virus and also leaving the system more prone to SARS-CoV-2 viral attack.

The prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is very broad, with a vast majority of people (50–80% based on different research scenarios, CDC) only having mild symptoms like the common cold or asymptomatic [7]; however, still, the other significant numbers (averagely 20–50% based on different ethnicity and pre-medical conditions) may progress into severe respiratory and systemic syndromes, needing immediate hospitalization and critical care [8,9,10,11,12]. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 ranges from 1.7–13.0% in different countries [7]. Except for the pathogenic impact of viral infection, major pathologies underlying severe COVID-19 come from the dysregulation of vast immune factors at both the cellular and molecular levels. For example, severe COVID-19 patients display macrophage overreaction (also known as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)) and lymphopenias of effective lymphocytes, including neutrophils, CD4 T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells [13,14,15]. At the molecular level, hyper-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, TNFα, S100A8/9, and C-reactive protein), a significant decrease of human leukocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) gene expression in CD14 monocytes, and dysregulated antiviral interferon (IFN) response have been reported in COVID-19 patients with critical illness [13,14,15]. In this review, we focus on the determinant role of dysfunctional IFN response underlying the progression of severe COVID-19. Interferon (IFN) system comprises a series of antiviral IFN cytokines, classified as type I, II, and III based on their distinct molecular signatures and recognition receptors in cells, to induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated effector genes (ISGs), exerting various antiviral and other immunomodulatory functions (Figure 1) [16,17,18]. The IFN molecules of three IFN types are further designated into subtypes, which include the single IFN-γ for type II and IFN-λ1-4 for type III, such as in humans. There are multiple subtypes of type I IFNs, which include general subtypes of IFN-α and IFN-β produced by most cells, and more cell-specific subtypes, including IFN-ε (reproductive tract), IFN-κ (keratinocytes), IFN-ω (leukocytes/epithelial cells), and species-specific subtypes of IFN-δ (pigs), IFN-τ (cattle), and IFN-ξ (mice) [16,17,18].",null,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pulmonary inflammatory disease induced by a newly recognized coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Several millions of people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and almost 382,867 human deaths worldwide have been reported so far. Notably, there has been no specific, clinically approved vaccine or anti-viral treatment strategy for COVID-19. Herein, we review COVID-19, the viral replication, and its effect on promoting pulmonary fibro-inflammation via immune cell-mediated cytokine storms in humans. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing for anti-viral drugs, vaccines, and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Viral clearance is the result of effective innate and adaptive immune responses. The pivotal role of interleukin (IL)-15 in viral clearance involves maintaining the balance of induced inflammatory cytokines and the homeostatic responses of natural killer and CD8+ T cells.

Clinically, COVID-19 is characterized by clinical manifestations, such as fever, dry cough, headache, and in more severe cases, respiratory distress. Moreover, neurological-, cardiac-, and renal-related symptoms have also been described. Clinical evidence suggests that migration of immune cells to the affected organs can produce an exacerbated release of proinflammatory mediators that contribute to disease and render the immune response as a major player during the development of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the current sanitary situation, the development of vaccines is imperative. Up to the date, 42 prototypes are being tested in humans in different clinical stages, with 10 vaccine candidates undergoing evaluation in phase III clinical trials. In the same way, the search for an effective treatment to approach the most severe cases is also in constant advancement. Several potential therapies have been tested since COVID-19 was described, including antivirals, antiparasitic and immune modulators. Recently, clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine—a promising drug in the beginning—were suspended. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved convalescent serum administration as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Here, we performed a systematic review of the current (pre)published SARS-CoV-2 literature with a focus on the evidence concerning SARS-CoV-2 distribution in human tissues and viral shedding in body fluids. In addition, this evidence is aligned with published ACE2 entry-receptor (single cell) expression data across the human body to construct a viral distribution and ACE2 receptor body map. We highlight the broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2, as many studies identified viral components (RNA, proteins) in multiple organs, including the pharynx, trachea, lungs, blood, heart, vessels, intestines, brain, male genitals and kidneys. This also implicates the presence of viral components in various body fluids such as mucus, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen and breast milk. The main SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, is expressed at different levels in multiple tissues throughout the human body, but its expression levels do not always correspond with SARS-CoV-2 detection, indicating that there is a complex interplay between virus and host.

The world faced a similar crisis in 1918 when the Spanish flu pandemic broke out [3]. Recent reports suggest that COVID-19 originated in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, on December 12, 2019, from where it quickly spread around the globe [4].

Patients with severe COVID-19 (Figure
1A arrows) are known to develop an extensive disease of the lung parenchyma like lobar pneumonia requiring hospitalization.1,50 There have been reports of patients with mild COVID-19 who have significant blood gas alteration and chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings without significant symptoms,2 which is alarming. The reason for the latter is that the patients without symptoms but an ongoing COVID-19 along with organ damage can complicate rapidly without giving the diagnosis and treatment a chance to save their lives.3 The alteration of PO2 and PCO2 in COVID-19 is complex4 and difficult to comprehend when compared to conventual viral cases of pneumonia. The reason for the added complexity of the alteration of PO2 and PCO2 in COVID-19 is the concurrent renal, gastrointestinal, and adrenal damage that are known contributors toward the maintenance of blood pH and blood gases and act as buffers to combat any alteration in these parameters that may occur.5 An alarming, but yet unexplored, component in COVID-19 is the damage to the neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) that has been reported to commence during the disease in some patients6−8 (Figure
1). Additionally, it is easy to compute the complexity that ongoing damage to respiratory regulating neurons in CNS would add to the aforementioned pulmonary damage in COVID-19. Also worrying are the reports of acute respiratory failure in 45–65% of cases in COVID-19 in which the patients lost spontaneous breathing, necessitating the use of ventilators, and eventually died.7 Some of the patients with COVID-19 that have been reported to recover from pneumonia, but could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation,9 and need to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism that can deteriorate and prove to be fatal.6,7 The occurrence of these spontaneous (autonomic) breathing control failures early in COVID-19 is alarming and possibly reflective of the damaging effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS nuclei that control normal involuntary breathing mechanics. SARS-CoV-2 probably invades the brain via axonal transport and transneuronal spread from the olfactory nerves on to the rhinencephalon, finally reaching the brainstem causing the irreversible respiratory failure seen in severe COVID-19, typically characterized by lack of dyspnea.3,9,10 Healthcare professionals should be heralded for the occurrence of acute respiratory arrest in early COVID-19, with some cases reflecting milder clinical evidence of hypoxia with accompanying hypocapnia and show no sense of breathlessness.3 Failure to comprehend and investigate the neurotropic potential of the virus,6,7,9 which has proven to be neurotoxic10−12 to the neurons in the brainstem,7,9 can result in more fatalities in COVID-19, by the time this clinically overt feature of SARS-CoV-2 gets investigated and draws our attention. In COVID-19, the respiratory symptoms are the most common, and neurogenic breathing failure is suspected in cases that have been reported.7,9,10,13 SARS-CoV-2 has challenged our complex computing ability to understand its pathogenesis. Along with this, notions such as COVID-19 being a mere flu, which like influenza and other viral pneumonia does not need to be worried about, has weakened our ability to stay ahead of the curve with this deadly virus.

The severe form of the infection is associated with death is mainly reported in older and immune-compromised patients with pre-existing disease history. Death in severe cases is attributed to respiratory failure associated with hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm syndrome associated with inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered as the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients have thus higher levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The blood laboratory profile of the COVID-19 patients exhibits lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and RNAaemia, along with increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortality, unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is, to date, no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates.

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2′) within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.

Once an immunological complication like cytokine storm occurs, anti-viral based monotherapy alone is not enough. Additional anti-inflammatory treatment is recommended. It must be noted that anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, TNF-α inhibitors, colchicine, etc., have been either suggested or are under trials for managing cytokine storm in COVID-19 infections. Natural astaxanthin (ASX) has a clinically proven safety profile and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. There is evidence from preclinical studies that supports its preventive actions against ALI/ARDS. Moreover, ASX has a potent PPARs activity. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that ASX could be considered as a potential adjunctive supplement. Here, we summarize the mounting evidence where ASX is shown to exert protective effect by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. We present reports where ASX is shown to prevent against oxidative damage and attenuate exacerbation of the inflammatory responses by regulating signaling pathways like NF-ĸB, NLRP3 and JAK/STAT. These evidences provide a rationale for considering natural astaxanthin as a therapeutic agent against inflammatory cytokine storm and associated risks in COVID-19 infection and this suggestion requires further validation with clinical studies."

During the SARS epidemic, patients often presented with respiratory-like illnesses that progressed to severe pneumonia, observations mirroring the disease course of COVID-19, suggesting that the lung is the primary tropism of SARS-CoV-2 [13]. Both CoVs were then found to bind the same entry receptor, ACE2 [1,14,15]. Of note, the key mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike make additional close contacts with ACE2, correlating with higher binding affinity and perhaps increased infectivity [1,14,16]. The presence of a unique furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is also suspected to enhance human transmission events, although this remains to be further investigated [17,18]. The currently predominant SARS-CoV-2 isolate worldwide carries a D614G mutation that is absent from its presumptive common ancestor, and is more infectious, likely underlying, in part, an increased human-to-human transmission efficiency [19., 20., 21.]. Although associated with an increased viral load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of patients with COVID-19, the D614G variant does not correlate with disease severity, suggesting that pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is linked to mechanisms that are more than just SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [21].",Published online 2020 Oct 16.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a world-wide pandemic since its onset in December of 2019.

The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic. Similarly, for the endoscopist, pancreatic endoscopy needs to be carefully regulated to reduce risk to both the patient and the physician and yet deliver optimum patient care.

Recent studies reveal that IFN dysregulation is key to determine COVID-19 pathogenesis. Effective IFN stimulation or prophylactic administration of IFNs at the early stage prior to severe COVID-19 may elicit an autonomous antiviral state, restrict the virus infection, and prevent COVID-19 progression. Inborn genetic flaws and autoreactive antibodies that block IFN response have been significantly associated with about 14% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In most severe COVID-19 patients without genetic errors in IFN-relevant gene loci, IFN dysregulation is progressively worsened and associated with the situation of pro-inflammation and immunopathy, which is prone to autoimmunity. In addition, the high correlation of severe COVID-19 with seniority, males, and individuals with pre-existing comorbidities will be plausibly explained by the coincidence of IFN aberrance in these situations.

All the SARS-CoV fall under the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and genus Beta-coronavirus. Most of the species under this head are enzootic and only a few of these species infect humans (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Currently, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been confirmed. Specifically, they are named as Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), which belong to the alpha-coronavirus genus; whereas Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1), SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belong to the beta-coronavirus genus.

The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus and mostly resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% sequence homology (Chan et al., 2020a). Currently, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced to human by an unidentified intermediary animal and then it has spread from human-to-human.",Published online 2020 Dec 13.,"CoVs are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, family Coronaviridae and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae [16], [30]. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae is further divided into Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Delta- CoVs [31]. Alpha- and Beta- CoVs are pathogenic to mammals, including human beings, bats, pigs, mice, and cats. Gamma- and Delta- CoVs are usually pathogenic to birds but rarely infectious to mammals [32]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV suggests that it is more closely related to bat-CoVs of the Sarbecovirus subgenus isolated from bats (Fig. 2). A SARS related (SARSr) bat-CoV strain named SARSr-CoV-RaTG13 detected in an Intermediate Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) [33], [34], was found very similar to SARS-CoV-2. The comparison of genome sequences revealed that SARSr-CoV-RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 sequences shared a similarity of more than 96% over a large part of the genome. However, the genomic region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, ORF1b and almost half of the spike (S) protein region of SARS-CoV-2 is divergent to SARSr-CoV-RaTG13 [35] but more closely related to pangolin CoV [36]. Considering that bats were in hibernation when the outbreak occurred [37], and the phylogenetic resemblance of Pangolin CoV strain to SARS-CoV-2, suggest that the virus is more likely to have been transmitted via other species. This also suggests that the possible occurrence of recombination between SARS-like-CoVs from pangolin and bats might have led to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [36] and the COVID-19 outbreak. Dorp et al., (2020) analyzed the emergence of genomic diversity over time and reported that all CoV sequences share a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. They further identified several recurrent mutations producing non-synonymous changes in the virus at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host [38]. Various sequencing projects and phylogenetic studies involving SARS-CoV-2 genomes from COVID-19 patients during this pandemic have revealed that how fast the virus is mutating and adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design [39], [40], [41]."

Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review.

Here, we examined 217 recovered COVID-19 patients to assess their viral RNA shedding and residual antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. We found that viral RNA remained detectable in 6.6% of recovered COVID-19 cases and up to 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.8%, 88.5%, and 83.4% of the recovered cases 4–12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Higher levels of antibodies detected were associated with severe illness patients experienced while hospitalized. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.9%) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies, suggesting probable exposure. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and antibody duration."

Surprisingly, the silence of the African research community has been unprecedented – contributing a paltry 0.6% (22 contributions), a figure nearly matched by Colombia (18 publications). Until now, a comprehensive perspective on the reasons for this subdued research response, and COVID-19 themes critical to Africa has been missing. We posit that while a milieu of factors accounts for this silence, unprecedented research opportunities exist to support COVID-19 decision and policy formulation in Africa. The subdued response reflects weak research systems, characterized by deep-rooted challenges, including severe lack of research expertise, funding, and infrastructure, coupled with poor working conditions. Hence, Africa's contribution to research on infectious diseases, including COVID-19, remains weak. Perceptions and attitudes among researchers and policy-makers on COVID-19, and the role of science in decision and policy-making also exist. Moreover, COVID-19 and earlier severe acute respiratory syndromes are considered as ‘imported diseases’ originating from outside Africa. Thus, notions may exist that the control methods will come from outside Africa through ‘technology-transfer’ or ‘capacity-building’. Yet local COVID-19 research is needed to address knowledge gaps, including; (1) potential novel transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) adaption of generic COVID-19 control measures to suit African settings, (3) occurrence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in solid waste, wastewaters, on-site sanitation systems, and drinking water, and (4) the ‘human factor’ including the role of gender, perceptions, myths, attitudes, and religious beliefs in the transmission and control of COVID-19.

We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response. Finally, anti-inflammatory cytokines like anti-interleukin 6 and administration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells may serve as potential immune modulatory therapies for supportively combating COVID-19. Obesity is conversely related to the development of COVID-19 through numerous molecular mechanisms and individuals with obesity belong to the COVID-19-susceptible population requiring more protective measures."

Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi from his team won the 2008 Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine for isolating and characterizing the HIV-1 for the first time.",Published online 2020 Oct 14.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020, triggering important changes for the entire society and healthcare systems, as well as significant lockdown measures aimed to limit the disease spread. We herein intended to catch the dynamic of Romanian physicians’ perceptions of COVID-19 impact. For this purpose, after a literature review, a 30-item questionnaire was designed. The questionnaire was twice distributed online, about 1 month apart, during which partial relaxation measures were decreed in Romania. The questionnaire was voluntarily filled in by Romanian physicians who were willing to participate in the study. A total of 214 physicians answered the questionnaire upon its first release, and 199 respondents were registered upon its second release, most of whom (94.9%) were involved in clinical work, with one-third working in units dedicated to COVID-19 patients. In parallel with the relaxation of lockdown measures, along with increased confidence in the efficiency of protective measures (46.7% vs. 31.3%), separation from household members decreased from 36.9% to 22.1%. Nevertheless, the feeling of rejection felt by doctors remained similar (22.4% vs. 24.6%). Furthermore, answers regarding the clinical picture, diagnostic approach, and treatment options are discussed. Most of therapeutic options considered for SARS-CoV-2 treatment (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma) failed to confirm significant efficiency. On the contrary, vaccines for widescale use are already available despite the initial skepticism. In the beginning of the pandemic, 25.2% (18.2% vs. 32.2%) considered that there will not be an effective COVID-19 vaccine, while 41.6% (43.0% vs. 40.2%) thought that a vaccine would be available after at least 12 months. In conclusion, initially, following only a 1 month period, Romanian physicians’ intention to consider treatments such as hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 decreased significantly. Moreover, confidence in the efficiency of available protective measures increased, and the rates of separation from household members decreased."

While symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily pulmonary (fever, dry cough, fatigue, pneumonia), it is becoming increasingly recognized that multiple organ systems can be affected, including the brain, with neurological involvement affecting up to ~36% of patients [1,2,3,4,5]. Information gained from studies of related coronaviruses in recent epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012) suggests that all three coronaviruses might have neurologic consequences [6,7], though the relative severity and frequency of neurologic involvement caused by coronaviruses varies and thus the extent to which SARS and MERS epidemics inform our understanding of COVID-19 remains unclear [5]. Nevertheless, the possibility has been raised that SARS-CoV-2 could invade the brain and cause neurological disease [2,8]. While appealing conceptually, data supporting the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS, CNS) are limited, as discussed below.

This novel virus is thought to enter and cause infection in its host through the attachment of its structural protein known as the S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 with its consequences globally, it is mandatory that health caregivers and researchers across all disciplines abreast themselves with the potential effects that this novel virus may have on their fields and the medical society at large. During the infection, the cardiovascular system is affected by unknown pathomechanistic processes, hence accounting for an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among COVID-19 patients. As cardiovascular researchers, we are more concerned about the cardiovascular aspect of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Hence, this concise review addresses these aspects where CVD as a risk factor of COVID-19, the prevalence of CVDs in COVID-19, and the potential cardiovascular disorders which may evolve owing to COVID-19 are discussed.

Developing effective vaccines and therapies requires understanding how the virus and the immune response affect disease pathology and how the adaptive immune system recognizes and ultimately clears the virus. To date, most efforts have focused on the B-cell-mediated antibody response to the virus. Notably, the vast majority of current vaccine development efforts are focused on eliciting neutralizing antibodies to the virus, most frequently by immunizing with the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or even with just the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (Vabret et al., 2020). How cytotoxic CD8+ T cells recognize and clear infected cells is less understood. In individuals who recovered from the closely related coronavirus SARS-CoV, virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells persist for at least 6–11 years, whereas memory B cells and anti-viral antibodies are largely undetectable at these later time points (Peng et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2011). Similarly, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most COVID-19 patients 10–15 days after symptom onset, but responses decline to baseline in many patients within 3 months (Seow et al., 2020). These findings suggest that vaccines focused solely on eliciting neutralizing antibodies to the S protein might be insufficient to elicit long-term immunity to coronaviruses. In mice infected with SARS-CoV, virus-specific CD8+ T cells are sufficient to enhance survival and diminish clinical disease (Zhao et al., 2010), and immunization with a single immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope confers protection against lethal viral infection (Channappanavar et al., 2014).

Their genomes are more than three times as big as those of HIV and hepatitis C, and more than twice influenza's. The E229 and OC43 coronaviruses discovered in 1966, were the first pathogenic CoV that crossed the species barrier and infected humans [4,5] followed by NL63 [6] and HKU1 [7]. As of now, these four endemic human CoV are responsible for up to 35% of seasonal common colds. Two of them (OC43 and HKU1) came from rodents, and the other two (E229 and NL63) from bats [8]. In 2002, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a CoV [9] originated from bats, was retrospectively named SARS-CoV-1. The epidemic ended in July 2003, after intense public health mitigation measures leaving behind a total of 8096 subjects infected and 774 (9.6%) fatalities in over thirty countries.

However, the current coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and named coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) became a major global pandemic. As of August 23, there are 23.4 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections globally with 807,134 fatalities due to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University's count.",null,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first emerged in Wuhan, China. The clinical manifestations of patients infected with COVID-19 include fever, cough, and dyspnea, up to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute cardiac injury. Thus, a lot of severe patients had to be admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spikes to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. The overexpression of human ACE-2 is associated with the disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating that viral entry into cells is a pivotal step. Although the lung is the organ that is most commonly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, acute kidney injury (AKI), heart dysfunction and abdominal pain are the most commonly reported co-morbidities of COVID-19. The occurrence of AKI in COVID-19 patients might be explained by several mechanisms that include viral cytopathic effects in renal cells and the host hyperinflammatory response. In addition, kidney dysfunction could exacerbate the inflammatory response started in the lungs and might cause further renal impairment and multi-organ failure. Mounting recent evidence supports the involvement of cardiovascular complications and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 syndrome, in addition to respiratory disease. To date, there is no vaccine, and no specific antiviral medicine has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19. The removal of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the shutdown of the cytokine storm could ameliorate the clinical outcome in severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, several interventions that inhibit viral replication and the systemic inflammatory response could modulate the severity of the renal dysfunction and increase the probability of a favorable outcome."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is used by the virus to enter and infect the cell, a process requiring priming of the viral S protein by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 [2]. ACE2 mRNA has been detected in the bronchi and lung parenchyma, as well as in the heart, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. This tissue distribution is consistent with the pathophysiology and clinical features of SARS infection and related disease [3]. ACE2 is a key modulator of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), which is a signaling pathway involved in the regulation of vascular and heart function [4]. The strict relationship of ACE2 with cardiovascular function supported the observation of a higher transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus in patients with hypertension or heart failure [5]. Inhibition of RAAS by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE—I) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), drugs largely used in the therapy of hypertension and heart failure, may result in a compensatory increase in tissue levels of ACE2 [6]. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this experimental observation generated the hypothesis that use of RAAS inhibitors might be detrimental in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Due to their unique maturation process, antibodies can emerge extremely particular to viral antigens [12]. The first use of immunoglobulins (antibodies) as a therapy opportunity for viral diseases can be hunted back to the beginning 20th century, using sera of infected people, who had improved from the same condition [13], [14]. This natural therapy regimen (serum therapy), was slowly replaced by immunoglobulins purified from merged sera, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) [15]. Notwithstanding the achievement of both serum therapeutics and IVIG, no meaningful advancement was made to produce antibodies as therapeutics. The hybridoma technique was continuously launched, facilitating the separation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from immunized mice in 1975 [16]. Various approaches have been established since the mid-1980s for the effective separation of mAbs toward viruses of human and animal sources [12]. To date, there are no confirmed vaccines or therapeutic medications that are special to COVID-19. Preventing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), owing to their fantastic antigen specificity, is among the most suitable nominees for compensating viral infection [17]. Hence, recognizing and cloning of mAbs that can accurately target viral superficies proteins to hinder the viral entrance to host cells is an acceptable strategy for blocking and handling COVID-19, mainly when effective vaccines and therapeutics medications are unavailable in the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [18]. mAbs targeting exposed positions on viral outside proteins are frequently identified as hopeful classes of drugs toward infectious disorders and have conferred therapeutic potency for numerous types of viruses [19], [20].

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of beta coronavirus family which upon exposure caused a highly infectious disease called novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a probably bat originated disease was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the disease has affected nearly 56,261,952 laboratory confirmed human population and caused deaths of over 1,349,506 lives worldwide. Virus passes in majority through respiratory droplets and then enters lung epithelial cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and there it undergoes replication and targeting host cells causing severe pathogenesis. Majority of human population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 having fully functional immune system undergo asymptomatic infection while 5–10% are symptomatic and only 1–2% are critically affected and requires ventilation support. Older people or people with co-morbidities are severely affected by COVID-19. These categories of patients also display cytokine storm due to dysfunctional immune response which brutally destroys the affected organs and may lead to death in some. Real time PCR is still considered as standard method of diagnosis along with other serology, radiological and biochemical investigations.

To date, four different common coronaviruses are known causing for millions of cases of respiratory infections all over the world. The SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus and has, based on decoration with glycoprotein spikes, a crown-like membrane. The nucleocapsid includes proteins and the RNA genome, which encodes polyproteins, e.g., replicase, proteases and structural proteins. All these proteins can interfere with the human innate immune system. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular receptor present in the lung, binds to viral proteins and serves as entry for the virus after host-viral membrane fusion. Subsequently, after endocytosis, the RNA genome is released into the host cell and translated and replicated within the cell. Detection of virus RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods is a keystone in diagnosing current infection with SAS-CoV-2, while detection of immunoglobulins helps to test for previous infections and immunity.

Here, the virus uses its trimeric Spike protein to latch onto host cell ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) receptor binding sites (Figure 1), via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this glycoprotein in the “prefusion” state (Cyranoski, 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020).

The virus enters cells by endocytosis. The 30 kb single-stranded plus-strand RNA is released directly into the cytoplasm and hijacks the cell to translate the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) in a double membrane vesicle. The RTC then produces RNAs that translate into protein, the ORFs coding for 16 nonstructural proteins, four main structural proteins and other special proteins (Oberfeld et al., 2020).

Because pain is a primary symptom of many types of infection and a lack of pain can help microbes to evade early detection, investigators have focused on microbe interactions with nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG). These studies have revealed insights into how bacterial products interact directly with nociceptors to either promote or inhibit pain.17 The Staphylococcus aureus bacteria produce N-formylated peptides and α-haemolysin, both of which act directly on nociceptors to cause pain during Staphylococcus infections.16 Another example is in tuberculosis where the Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces sulfolipid-1 that acts on transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)-positive neurons to evoke cough.73 On the other end of this spectrum, nociceptors can also play a key role in reducing bacterial pathogenesis, such as in the case of Salmonella enterica where calcitonin gene-related peptide released from TRPV1-positive neurons protects against infection after the detection of the pathogen by nociceptor nerve endings in the gut.42 These studies demonstrate the intricacies of how bacteria can interact with nociceptors to promote pain, influence infection severity, or play a key role in promoting the spread of disease.",null,

The ability to stratify patients and assess possible sequelae is critically important in this new era in which we live. Proteomics has the potential to define the disease status in many scenarios. Much of what we know so far has come from hospital laboratories and relates to proteins that are quantified in the course of routine analyses. Elevated concentrations of immunological markers (e.g., interleukins) are consistent with a “cytokine storm” hypothesis, whereas elevated concentrations of D-dimer, for example, have implicated inappropriate blood coagulation as a possible contributor to pathogenesis. A number of studies have reported associations between protein concentrations and disease severity, and predictive algorithms have begun to be formulated on this basis. The first mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analyses of patients’ blood were reported a few weeks into the pandemic, and the picture emerging from these is one of systemic perturbation. Now there is a need for clinical sensitivity plus specificity about any biomarker signature associated with COVID-19 with respect to making clinical decisions based on biomarker data.

Since the ACE2 receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed in vascular endothelium of the CNS, this can explain the neurotropic potential of the virus (18, 19). To date, only a few reports have confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while the key manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 remain predominantly in the lungs and in the immune system. Of note, is that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is easily detected in the respiratory tract or the blood, allowing for a clear diagnosis of COVID-19. The severity and haste of the COVID-19 clinical course limit the accessibility for sampling and testing of CSF. However, several case studies have shown a clear link between severe COVID-19 infection and neurological manifestations, such as encephalitis, seizures, and cerebrovascular complications. Other common manifestations reported are dizziness, headaches, confusion, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. A retrospective study showed that 78 of 214 (36.4%) patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 presented characteristic neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitals from Wuhan, China (20). Elderly patients that are commonly presented with a more severe disease, are more likely to develop neurological symptoms compared to non-severe and younger patients. Similarly, a hospital in France reported that 49 of the 58 consecutive patients admitted for Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19, presented neurological manifestations (21). The most characteristic neurological manifestations presented by these patients were encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and diffuse corticospinal tract signs. A case study that described the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 pneumonia, showed that 50 out of 235 ICU patients (21%) developed neurological symptoms (22). Brain MRIs were performed in 27 out of the 50 (54%) patients with neurologic symptoms, and 10 out of 27 (37%) patients presented cortical signal abnormalities. In some cases, the observed abnormal cortical signals were accompanied by cortical diffusion restriction, leptomeningeal enhancement, or cortical blooming artifact. CSF obtained in 5 out of 10 patients with cortical signal abnormalities, showed negative for SARS-CoV-2. The authors explained the difficulties in discerning between direct neurotropism of COVID-19 with others virus-related manifestations such as cytokine storm syndrome, hypoxia, subclinical seizures and encephalopathy (22). An early report in March 2020, described a 74-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, cardioembolic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (23). The patient presented with severe alteration in mental status and was found to be encephalopathic. Cerebrospinal fluid studies did not show any evidence of CNS infection, however, due to the progression of his symptoms, the patient was tested for COVID-19 and was confirmed positive. Unfortunately, no further details were available in the case report. The authors concluded that SARS-CoV-2 does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and does not cause meningitis or encephalitis. This case report highlighted the importance of recognizing that encephalopathy may be a potential manifestation of COVID-19 (23). The first reported case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 was observed in a 24-year-old man, and was reported in April 2020 (24). The patient was brought to the hospital due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness and was diagnosed with meningitis and viral pneumonia. Interestingly, the nasopharyngeal sample was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but was positive in the CSF sample. Moriguchi and colleagues declared the importance of this case because it shows that unconscious patients are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might cause the horizontal infection. The report warned the physicians of patients who have CNS symptoms that encephalitis may be the first indication, as well as respiratory symptoms, in identifying SARS-CoV-2 cases. Another case of meningitis, also reported in April 2020 by Duong et al., was detected in a 41-year-old female (25). Nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but they were unable to send her CSF sample for PCR testing to confirm for COVID-19. While the authors reported of COVID-19 infection as an isolated case of meningoencephalitis without respiratory involvement, they couldn't directly confirm the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the CSF (25). In May 2020, an update on the case reported earlier by Duong et al. confirmed that the CSF sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was the first case where SARS-CoV-2 infection was completely constrained to the CNS, with no association to other organs (26).",Published online 2020 Jul 12.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad and varies from mild to severe forms complicated by acute respiratory distress and death.

Information on this issue might derive from interventional studies. However, results from high-quality trials are scarce.

The new disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 was named “COVID-19” by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 [1].",Published online 2020 Aug 3.,"The first incidence of COVID-19 was reported in the Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in late December 2019. Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19."

SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade of beta coronaviruses encompassing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2020). Although most cases of the disease caused by most pathogenic coronaviruses are mild (Su et al., 2016), the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively, demonstrated their high lethality (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). SARS-CoV-2 bears an 82% resemblance to the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2020); however, COVID-19 presents a lower case fatality rate and higher infectiousness than SARS, with mortality rates of approximately 3.7% for COVID-19 and 10% for SARS (WHO, 2003, WHO, 2020a). COVID-19 patients often exhibit mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue and generally have a good prognosis.

Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV‑2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV‑2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection.

Informed implementation of government public health policies depends on accurate data on SARS-CoV-2 immunity at a population scale. We hypothesized that detection of SARS-CoV-2 salivary antibodies could serve as a noninvasive alternative to serological testing for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity at a population scale. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology that comprised 12 CoV antigens, mostly derived from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Saliva and sera collected from confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and from the pre-COVID-19 era were tested for IgG, IgA, and IgM to the antigen panel. Matched saliva and serum IgG responses (n = 28) were significantly correlated. The salivary anti-N IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity (100%), exhibiting a positive response in 24/24 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases sampled at >14 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), whereas the salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response yielded 100% specificity. Temporal kinetics of IgG in saliva were consistent with those observed in blood and indicated that most individuals seroconvert at around 10 DPSO. Algorithms employing a combination of the IgG responses to N and S antigens result in high diagnostic accuracy (100%) by as early as 10 DPSO. These results support the use of saliva-based antibody testing as a noninvasive and scalable alternative to blood-based antibody testing."

Diverse neurological signs and symptoms have been associated with COVID-19, ranging from mild symptoms (e.g., anosmia, ageusia, headache, dizziness) to severe complications, such as seizures, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage (Mao et al., 2020; Romero-Sánchez et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020). Consensus criteria for the diagnosis and classification of the severity of Neuro-COVID have been proposed (Fotuhi et al., 2020; Paterson et al., 2020). The prevalence of Neuro-COVID varies considerably between individual studies ranging from 4.1% (Xiong et al., 2020) to 57.4% (Romero-Sánchez et al., 2020) and even 84% in COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Helms et al., 2020).

Fourteen observational studies offer evidence that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence to date generally satisfies Hill’s criteria for causality in a biological system, namely, strength of association, consistency, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility (e.g., mechanisms), and coherence, although experimental verification is lacking. Thus, the evidence seems strong enough that people and physicians can use or recommend vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19 in light of their safety and wide therapeutic window.

The pandemic has become the greatest global public health crisis since the 1918 influenza outbreak [1]. Currently, the number of individuals with COVID-19 is still soaring worldwide. As of November 3, 2020, according to the WHO, confirmed COVID-19 patients exceeded 46 millions with over 1.2 million deaths worldwide [2,3]. In Iran, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 19 February 2020 and although in early March the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak appeared to dwindle in China [4], the outbreak in Iran increased. This was largely caused by a relaxing of bans by people who were preparing for the annual Nowruz ceremony and an underestimation of the seriousness of COVID-19, according to local sources. At the time of preparing this manuscript, the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in Iran had reached 284 034, of whom 15 074 had died, based on WHO sources. In Asia and globally, Iran has the second and tenth rankings, respectively, in terms of COVID-19 mortality rate, according to its official statistics reported to WHO. In addition, Iran has the eighth highest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the world [5]. Total number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Iran and worldwide along with their outcomes are compared and presented in Fig.1.",Published online 2020 Sep 2.,"No definitive treatment for COVID-19 exists although promising results have been reported with remdesivir and glucocorticoids. Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied."

The number of infected cases outside China exponentially increased across the continents. As of 22 July 2020, over 14.9 million confirmed cases and more than 610,000 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, raising a global concern [2].

Therefore, vaccination represents one of the most promising counter-pandemic measures to COVID-19. However, to date, no licensed vaccine exists, neither for SARS-CoV-2 nor for the closely related SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV.

In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. ≈ 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. ≈ 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 gene regions in PCS (92.7, 90.6%, n = 6) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%, n = 5). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human 18S rRNA, making PMMoV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMoV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMoV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities."

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne via droplets generated by symptomatic patients, and possibly asymptomatic individuals during incubation of the disease, although for the latter, there are no certain data yet. However, research on asymptomatic viral infection is currently ongoing worldwide to elucidate the real prevalence and mortality of the disease. From a clinical point of view, COVID-19 would be defined as “COVID Planet “ because it presents as a multifaceted disease, due to the large number of organs and tissues infected by the virus. Overall, based on the available published data, 80.9% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild disease/infection, 13.8% severe pneumonia, 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure, and 3% of these cases are fatal, but mortality parameter is highly variable in different countries. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia and a “cytokine storm syndrome”, characterized by a severe and fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) with development of endothelitis and generalized thrombosis that can lead to organ failure and death. Risk factors include advanced age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

As of May 10th, there are over four million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and almost 280,000 deaths globally [1]. The first known case of COVID-19 originated from the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. From there, it has spread to every inhabited continent worldwide. The virus originates from a large class of viruses known as β-coronaviruses common in nature, with many potential natural primary, intermediate, and final hosts [2]. SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus that typically affects the respiratory system, whereby the main known route of transmission occurs due to the spread of droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs or through other mucus environments, including saliva or discharge from the nose [3]. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], whereby it predominantly infects the lower respiratory tract, binding to ACE2 on alveolar epithelial cells [13]. Upon binding, there is a subsequent response of the immune system via inflammation-related manifestations and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells [10,11,12]. The infectious capacity of the virus in conjunction with the high fatality rates (1%–>5%) has left the world scrambling to bring the pandemic under control [6,7,8,9,14,15]. COVID-19 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic infection, or patients can present with a mild upper respiratory tract illness that may include a cough, chills, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath [15]. In severe cases, the most common complications are sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart failure, and septic shock. However, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure can potentially lead to death [16]. Multiple organ dysfunction is likely attributable to uncontrolled acute inflammation and cytokine storm release [10,11,12,17,18,19]. As our knowledge of the disease is evolving, it is clear that other symptoms are being identified, including chilblains [20], sudden anosmia or ageusia [21], and even stroke [22].",Published online 2020 Aug 12.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.

This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats."

Among those, renin-angiotensin (Ang) system (RAS) and its regulator angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) seem to play critical roles. The RAS and ACE2 has shown an important role in maintaining proper physiological functions of kidneys, heart, and lungs. Any malfunction of this system may lead to the pathogenicity of these organs (Zou et al., 2020). ACE2 is most abundantly expressed in kidneys, heart, lungs, and endothelium (Donoghue et al., 2000). Moreover, ACE2 plays regulatory roles in the hemostasis of the local concentrations of Ang II and Ang1-7 in cardiovascular system (Michot et al., 2020). Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory agent which enhances fibrosis and is one of the main constituents of RAS. Besides, Ang I is the main substrate of ACE1 which is degraded to Ang II by a carboxypeptidase enzyme. Its carboxypeptidase activity is different from dipeptidase activity of ACE. Therefore, ACE inhibitors (ACEI) have no antagonizing effect on ACE2 (Yong et al., 2016). Virus entry into the cell is initiated by binding of S protein-ligand on the virus and ACE2 receptors on the tissue cell. The spike protein on the virus membrane binds to its receptor and direct membrane fusion of host cell and virus is the first step of viral entrance (Zhou et al., 2020). After virus entrance, its RNA genome and translation products including two polyprotein/structural proteins will be released. The first site of virus replication is epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and further proliferation occurs at the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa (Li et al., 2003). Besides, transmembrane serine protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the S protein of the virus and exposes the fusion component of the virus. After this step, fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane will be facilitated and virus entry takes place (McCreary et al., 2020). Besides, AP2 associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is one of the other regulators of SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis into the host cell. Several inflammatory receptors and downstream mediators, as well as ACE and AAK1 are also gateways involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Ziai et al., 2020). Thus, their targeting would be of great importance."

Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiologic changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes in high-risk pregnancies may affect the pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin-(1-7) (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering angiotensin-(1-7) levels, which can mimic/worsen the vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials. We summarize guidelines for medical/obstetric care and outline future directions for optimization of treatment and preventive strategies for pregnant patients with COVID-19 with the understanding that relevant data are limited and rapidly changing."

Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing long-term complications. Oxytocin (OXT), an immune-regulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance. It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates T-lymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID-19. Additionally, OXT can promote γ-interferon expression to inhibit cathepsin L and increases superoxide dismutase expression to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation. Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures. Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension and brain-heart syndrome, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes. Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the side-effects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid. Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Although these in vitro and anecdotal data are still limited and the mechanisms of the anti-COVID-19 effects remain unclear, the apparent efficacy and safety of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine have attracted much attention for application of these drugs as potential therapies for COVID-19. Chloroquine phosphate was therefore recommended in the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. An open-label nonrandomized study by Gautret et al. [7] that used hydroxychloroquine in combination in some patients with azithromycin, an azalide antibiotic with putative antiviral properties, has garnered unusual attention. Hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin was granted limited emergency-use authorization by the USA FDA to treat COVID-19 patients. Preliminary clinical data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine prevented the exacerbation of pneumonia, promoted viral clearance and shortened the disease course in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [7–10]. Until May 13th, 2020, a total of 182 clinical trials proposed using hydroxychloroquine, and 58 studies that proposed using chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 were registered with the FDA (Tables 2 and 3). For patients diagnosed with mild, moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 500 mg chloroquine phosphate tablets were given twice a day for 10 days according to the sixth and seventh editions of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 recommended by the NHC of China. In several other countries, including the United States, hydroxychloroquine has been administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to its higher in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and wider availability in these countries compared with chloroquine phosphate.",Published online 2020 Aug 28.,The possibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission to neonates through breast milk remains unverified.

Similarly to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MER) viruses [1–3], SARS-CoV-2 targets the brain (reviewed [4]) and a growing number of case reports and cohort studies indicate significant neurological disturbance in COVID-19 patients (reviewed [5]). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement including non-specific encephalopathy (headache, confusion, and disorientation) was first documented in 53/214 (25%) hospitalised patients in Wuhan, China [6]. More recent studies in Europe have reported higher rates of CNS involvement: 69% of 58 hospitalised patients in a French Study [7], and 31% of 125 cases with altered mental state, including psychosis and neurocognitive changes, in a recent UK survey [8]. A recent report described a ‘dysexecutive syndrome consisting of inattention, disorientation, or poorly organised movements in response to command’ in 33% of 43 patients discharged from hospital [7]. Moreover, neuroradiological evidence of microstructural damage and disruption of functional brain integrity at 3-month follow-up in recovered COVID-19 patients [9] indicates potential long-term neurological consequences in severely affected COVID-19 patients (reviewed [10]). Acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD), typically presenting as ischaemic stroke but occasionally as intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), has emerged as an important clinical feature in COVID-19 (reviewed in [5]). There have also been multiple case reports of encephalitis with brain-stem involvement (reviewed in [5]). CNS involvement with neurological presentation is more frequent in older and more severely ill COVID-19 patients [6]. Based on the minimum prevalence of neurological complications in SARS and MERS, Ellul et al. [5] estimated that of the reported 4.8 million COVID-19 cases at the time, 1805–9671 had developed CNS complications.",Published online 2020 Nov 10.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially compromises their innate immune system. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the affected cell. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia-induced glycosylation of ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the binding of S protein to ACE2, enabling viral entry. Downregulation of ACE2 activity secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II and metabolites, eventually leads to poor outcomes. The altered binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the compromised innate immunity of patients with DM increase their susceptibility to COVID-19; COVID-19 induces pancreatic β-cell injury and poor glycemic control, which further compromises the immune response and aggravates hyperglycemia and COVID-19 progression, forming a vicious cycle. Sequential cleavage of viral S protein by furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers viral entry to release the viral genome into the target cell. Hence, TMPRSS2 and furin are possible drug targets. As type 1 DM exhibits a Th1-driven autoimmune process, the relatively lower mortality of COVID-19 in type 1 DM compared to type 2 DM might be attributed to an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 immunity. The anti-inflammatory effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor may benefit patients with DM and COVID-19. The potential protective effects of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), including reduction in lactate level, prevention of lowering of cytosolic pH and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may justify the provision of SGLT2i to patients with DM and mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. For patients with DM and COVID-19 who require hospitalization, insulin-based treatment is recommended with cessation of metformin and SGLT2i. Further evidence from randomized or case–control clinical trials is necessary to elucidate the effectiveness and pitfalls of different types of medication for DM."

So far Covid-19 seems to be more contagious and more deadly than most strains of seasonal influenza. In fact, without containment measures, the basic reproduction number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated in the range of 2.2 and 5.7, meaning one case may infect between two and five other persons, while for seasonal influenza this number is reportedly around 1.3 [2,3]. Fatality rates for Covid-19 differ significantly in magnitude across countries. Discrepancies most likely depend, among other factors, on the frequency of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients as well as on the testing strategy adopted in different settings, which may result in a significant proportion of undiagnosed cases. An accurate estimate of the overall infection fatality is still very difficult to calculate. Recent estimates based on aggregate data from China adjusted for demography and under-ascertainment bias suggest that the overall case fatality rate of Covid-19 could be close to 1.38% [4]. However, taking into account the ratio of asymptomatic cases support infection fatality ratios hovering 0.4–0.7% [5]. These figures are lower than that of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had case fatality rates around 10% and 36% respectively [6], yet they seem to exceed those of most severe influenza strains, which have case fatality rates averaging 0.1%. The reasons why some patients progress to severe disease while others only manifest with mild or no symptoms remain to be elucidated.

The pathologies stemming from CoVs predominantly damage the respiratory, central nervous, intestinal, and hepatic systems (4). CoVs have the largest genome size among RNA viruses and are subdivided into four genera: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Deltacoronavirus. Until 2003, it was imagined that only two CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were responsible for infections of the upper respiratory tract, ranging in respiratory symptoms such as the common cold, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, but many researchers suspected that there existed more than two HCoVs (5, 6) ( Figure 1 ). Unexpectedly, a widespread epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) broke out between November 2002 and September 2003 that originated in Foshan, Guangdong province, China (7). The SARS-CoV-1 is an extremely pathogenic virus with an overall fatality rate of around 10%, reaching more than 8,000 human infections spanning 29 different countries (8). The SARS-CoV-1 is very contagious and displays influenza-like symptoms, including high fever, myalgia, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and pneumonia (9). The organization of the SARS-CoV-1 genome (29,740 bases long, positive-stranded RNA) is similar to that of other CoVs (10). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS epidemic to be contained on July 5, 2003, and since then, no SARS outbreaks were reported. Then, in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and became the second most pathogenic member of the Coronaviridae family in humans in the 21st century. MERS-CoV was first identified in sputum samples of a man in Saudi Arabia admitted with pneumonia (11). Camels were later identified as the cause of spillover to humans and caused the high case-fatality rates in humans across the globe, spanning 27 countries (12). Between 2012 and 2017, WHO reported nearly 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with at least 858 deaths, the majority from Saudi Arabia. In December 2019, the WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China—the third spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans (13). This newly emerged CoV, adopted as SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of a cluster of upper respiratory tract infections or so-called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which rapidly emerged in China and rapidly spread to all countries on the globe (13, 14). The WHO declared this rapid escalation of COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 and cases continue to rise all over the world, triggering a devastating global health crisis.

In fact, retrospective studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has already been circulating for several weeks, probably since October 2019, with a case of COVID-19 formally identified on 17 November 2019 [3]. Among 10 237 infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 included in a nationwide cohort in South Korea (24 January to 9 April 2020), 6350 individuals (62%) were asymptomatic [4]. In another study on 1096 individuals in Kuwait (24 February to 20 April 2020), 46.3% of the infected people were asymptomatic on the sample day [5]. Thirty-five individuals (6.9%) who were initially asymptomatic developed symptoms later [5].

Alongside advanced age, male gender and pre-existing co-morbidities [e.g., obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)] are emerging as significant risk factors for COVID-19. Interestingly, immunesenescence is more profound in males when compared to females, whilst accelerated aging of the immune system, termed premature immunesenescence, has been described in obese subjects and T2D patients. Thus, as three distinct demographic groups with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 share a common immune profile, could immunesenescence be a generic contributory factor in the development of severe COVID-19? Here, by focussing on three key aspects of an immune response, namely pathogen recognition, elimination and resolution, we address this question by discussing how immunesenescence may weaken or exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We also highlight how aspects of immunesenescence could render potential COVID-19 treatments less effective in older adults and draw attention to certain therapeutic options, which by reversing or circumventing certain features of immunesenescence may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of groups at high risk of severe COVID-19."

However, the exact mechanism is still unknown, but multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the putative antiviral properties determined with azithromycin drug. Some researches states that azithromycin acts as acidotropic lipophilic weak base, which changes (increase) the pH level of endosome maturation and trans-golgi network (Asai et al., 2020; Choudhary & Sharma 2020). Moreover, it can potentially inhibit endocytosis and viral genetic shedding from lysosomes, ultimately restricting viral replication (Gravesen & Judy 2020).

Furthermore, azithromycin directly acts on bronchial epithelial cells by decreasing mucus secretion to enable and enhances the lung function (Choudhary & Sharma 2020). Recently, quantum mechanical modeling proposed a possible role of azithromycin drug in interfering with viral entry through binding collaboration between the COVID-19 spike protein and host receptor ACE2 protein (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) (Figure 3) (Basit et al., 2020; Choudhary & Sharma 2020; Lobo-Galo et al., 2020). However, clinical trials are still necessary to confirm the role of the drug and its work as prophylaxis in reducing the infection rate. Azithromycin is currently under clinical trial and has reached phase IV with promising results (NCT02048007)."

While SARS-CoV-2 is related and similar in structure to its older relatives SARS-CoV and Middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of the Coronavirus family, which caused the SARS and MERS epidemics, respectively, this novel strain has rapidly spread across continents causing the worst pandemic of the 21st century. A striking feature of COVID-19 is the demographics of the populations afflicted. While men suffer worse outcomes and higher mortality rates than women, and individuals of black and hispanic race/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected (Gadi et al., 2020; Kopel et al., 2020; Muñoz-Price et al., 2020), most notably, elderly individuals >60 years of age have been most severely afflicted as evidenced by the significantly high morbidity and mortality in this group (Santesmasses et al., 2020). A majority of cases and deaths in every country worldwide involves the aging population, and numbers correlate with increasing age.

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic."

The effects of coronavirus are highly devastating with time over the human environment and ecology, resulting in a huge global environmental transition. The spread of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus was initially originated from a specific city of China named Wuhan. Gradually, due to human intervention and contact, the disease started transmitting in the global platform from one nation to another. At present times, it is one of the main causes of the global pandemic thus changing the environmental scenario in different geographical and climatic conditions. As it is referred to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, it is directly associated with airborne transmission. Previously, it is proved that such viral transmission is prone to several acute respiratory problems when it is present in the aerosol form [1]. According to WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, there are various modes of viral transmission related to SARS-CoV-2. The modes of viral transmission are generally categorized into 3 types, which are stated as airborne transmission, direct contact transmission (i.e., that generally gets directly transferred via direct contact with the contaminated surface), which is also referred to as fomite transmission, and droplet transmission (i.e. transmits in form of large respiratory droplets) [2]. Droplet transmission occurs when two persons are in close contact with each other (within 1 m), and the respiratory droplets accordingly get transferred in the form of an aerosol. The infectious droplet can transmit to human eyes, nose, and mouth when they are exposed to such contagious respiratory droplets [3]. This particular respiratory syndrome is associated or results in the development of several chronic or acute disorders like fever, dry cough, breathing problems, pneumonia, dyspnea which may finally lead to respiratory failure or death [4]. Ambient air pollution caused due to PM2.5 is a global environmental issue because it is categorized under one of the primary atmospheric hazards leading to vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, severity in cardiovascular conditions, improper vasomotor responses, etc [5]. Continuous exposure to PM2.5 has a dangerous impact on the fast progression of cancer, fibrotic diseases having in vivo, and in vitro effects on various pulmonary cells [6]. Fine particulate aerosol matter in the ambient atmosphere is an indirect means of respiration which involves the pro-inflammation and oxidation mechanism within the human body [7]. According to a particular study done in the United States, it is being found that 63% of air samples were tested positive. Moreover, the air in several patient rooms, hospital lawns as well as the ambient atmosphere near hospital arenas in Nebraska, USA contains a viral load of 2.9 copies/L [8]. New Delhi, Mumbai in India as well as several cities of India and China are some of the most polluted cities in the world. It is found those population and pollution indexes are connected equivalently which combinedly poses a severe threat over the present pandemic situation in the world [9]. In terms of PM2.5 and NOX, New Delhi is the second most polluted city in the world. At the same point of time, it is a leading city in terms of COVID-19 infection [9]. These toxic contaminants are two primary outdoor pollutants responsible for drastic health impacts on mankind [10]. It is being found that hazardous air pollutants like sulfur, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter lead to significant health impacts over human biology through socio-economic pathways thus affecting the anthropogenic ecosystem. Prolonged exposure to particulate dust actually harms the climate scenario globally [11]. In general, it is always to be kept in mind that all kinds of severe respiratory cardiovascular diseases are combined effects of viral infections and air hazards [12]. Considering the health point of view, the earth has undergone a huge transformation thus changing the human lifestyle accordingly.",null,null

The typical symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, evolving to a clinical picture of pneumonia and, ultimately, death. Nausea and diarrhea are equally frequent, suggesting viral infection or transmission via the gastrointestinal-enteric system. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is cleaved by transmembrane proteases during host cells infection, thus reducing its activities. ACE2 is a relevant player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the aminoacid transporter B0AT1. It has been suggested that B0AT1/ACE2 complex in the intestinal epithelium regulates gut microbiota (GM) composition and function, with important repercussions on local and systemic immune responses against pathogenic agents, namely virus. Notably, productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2+ mature human enterocytes and patients’ GM dysbiosis was recently demonstrated. This review outlines the evidence linking abnormal ACE2 functions with the poor outcomes (higher disease severity and mortality rate) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing age-related comorbidities and addresses a possible role for GM dysbiosis.

The pandemic disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), had 5,867,727 confirmed cases by 29th May 2020 and resulted in 362,238 deaths globally, as sourced by the Coronavirus Resource Center, John Hopkins University (JHU) (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% genomic similarity with the other SARS-CoVs, while two other bat-SARS-CoV-like viruses (retrieved from Rhinolophus sinicus, Zhoushan, China), viz., bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 were found to have >89% similarity [1]. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has crossed all continental boundaries, and presently Europe and North America have been its major epicenters. The COVID-19 symptoms are comparable to those produced by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, the earliest estimate showed its lower (2%) fatality rate, while about ~ 20% of COVID-19 patients had developed severe conditions [2]. SARS-CoV-2 tropism to the lungs/respiratory system is prominent, in which it infects the lung cells and causes interstitial pneumonitis that may lead to developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations related to the cardiovascular (CV) system causing multiple organ failure [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Amongst severe COVID-19 patients, 23% of cases had cardiac injuries [9] and, therefore, highlighted this as a common feature that promotes disease severity. Of note, elevated levels of creatinine kinase (CK; >200U/L) in 13% of COVID-19 patients in the general cohort, where most of these lacked any cytokine storm-induced systemic inflammatory response, further affirmed the association of COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications [2]. The common CV complications reported in COVID-19 patients include arrhythmia, myocardial injury (marked by higher troponin I (hs-cTnI) and CK levels) and myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure and cardiomyopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [3,4,10,11]. Although the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with these manifestations is now known, preexisting CV comorbidities could further contribute to COVID-19 severity and mortality [3,4,10,11]. The earliest report describing a meta-analysis of the COVID-19 clinical cohort revealed a strikingly high existing prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hospitalized patients, that made them prone to require critical care [10]. COVID-19 patients with CVDs were found to have a relatively five-fold higher mortality risk as compared to the patients with no CVD background [4].",null,"As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus pandemic continues to grow globally, an association is apparent between patients with underlying cardiovascular disease comorbidities and the risk of developing severe COVID-19.

Typically, bats are the natural reservoir for coronaviruses, although transmission to humans often occurs via an intermediate host, which is still under debate for SARS-CoV-2.

The WHO identified a novel group 2B betacoronavirus that causes viral pneumonia and subsequently announced the standard nomenclature for the disease as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 (WHO, 2020a). At the same time, this novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020). This virus is highly homologous to two other coronaviruses that have emerged over the past two decades: SARS-CoV that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and MERS-CoV that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both of which resulted in high mortality and morbidity. Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, its transmission rate is higher, which could be explained by mutation and enhanced genetic recombination at the S-protein in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (Shereen, Khan, Kazmi, Bashir, & Siddique, 2020).",Published online 2020 Sep 23.,"COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease but up to two thirds of hospitalised patients show evidence of central nervous system (CNS) damage, predominantly ischaemic, in some cases haemorrhagic and occasionally encephalitic. It is unclear how much of the ischaemic damage is mediated by direct or inflammatory effects of virus on the CNS vasculature and how much is secondary to extracranial cardiorespiratory disease. Limited data suggest that the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus may enter the CNS via the nasal mucosa and olfactory fibres, or by haematogenous spread, and is capable of infecting endothelial cells, pericytes and probably neurons. Extracranially, SARS-CoV-2 targets endothelial cells and pericytes, causing endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular leakage and immune activation, sometimes leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. It remains to be confirmed whether endothelial cells and pericytes in the cerebral vasculature are similarly targeted. Several aspects of COVID-19 are likely to impact on cognition. Cerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic damage in COVID-19 and is also critically important for cognitive function. There is accumulating evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and is linked to tau and TDP-43 pathology, and by inducing phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine-129, ischaemia may also increase the risk of development of Lewy body disease. Current therapies for COVID-19 are understandably focused on supporting respiratory function, preventing thrombosis and reducing immune activation. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are predicted to increase ACE-2 expression, it was initially feared that their use might exacerbate COVID-19. Recent meta-analyses have instead suggested that these medications are protective. This is perhaps because SARS-CoV-2 entry may deplete ACE-2, tipping the balance towards angiotensin II-ACE-1-mediated classical RAS activation: exacerbating hypoperfusion and promoting inflammation. It may be relevant that APOE ε4 individuals, who seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19, also have lowest ACE-2 activity. COVID-19 is likely to leave an unexpected legacy of long-term neurological complications in a significant number of survivors. Cognitive follow-up of COVID-19 patients will be important, especially in patients who develop cerebrovascular and neurological complications during the acute illness."

The mortality pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher in older versus younger adults and almost absent in children, is possibly caused by the effects of age and pre-existing comorbidities on innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we speculate that the abnormal and excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection partly depends on T cell immunological memory, which is more pronounced in adults compared with children, and may significantly contribute to immunopathology and massive collateral damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients."

The ACE enzyme converts angiotensin I (Ang I), a decapeptide to angiotensin II (Ang II), an octapeptide that binds to the AT1 receptor to induce vasoconstrictor response, which is a well-known target for the treatment of cardiovascular complications [1,2]. ACE 2 is a type I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase, composed of a single HEXXH zinc-binding domain and is a homologue of ACE with 40% similarity. ACE 2 is able to hydrolyze angiotensin I (Ang I) to produce angiotensin (1–9) and inactivates potent vasoconstrictor Ang II to produce angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang I-7). The enzyme is able to cleave several peptides from other systems such as the kinin metabolites, neurotensin 1–13, apelin 13, dynorphin 1–13 [3]. The enzyme has vasodilator property as an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor Mas, stimulates prostaglandin synthesis and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscles [[4], [5], [6]]. ACE 2 is a membrane-bound enzyme and is most abundantly present in the intestine, kidney and heart compared to other organs such as lungs and arteries [7,8]. Several reports from the literature, have indicated that ACE 2 is highly expressed in the reproductive organs, placenta, uterus and, maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy; which is important for normal fetal growth and also for regulation of the Ang II level. Besides, renal ACE 2 is also upregulated in pregnant women, further in comparison; the placenta shows the highest expression of renal ACE 2 mRNA, followed by kidney and, then the uterus; whereas, the ACE 2 activity is higher in kidney in comparison to placenta and uterus (Table 1 ) [[11], [12], [13], [14]].",null,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for more sensitive molecular diagnosis to improve sensitivity of current viral nuclear acid detection.

The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) improvement of viral RNA integrity was supported by (a) the AP increased resistance of the targeted gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to RNase treatment; (b) the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by AP-PCR with lower cycle threshold values (−2.7 cycles) compared to two commercially available assays; (c) improvement of the viral RNA stability of the ORF gene upon targeting of the N gene and RNase. Furthermore, the improved sensitivity by AP-PCR was demonstrated by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 70–80% of sputum, nasal, pharyngeal swabs and feces and 36% (4/11) of urine of the confirmed cases (n = 252), 7% convalescent cases (n = 54) and none of 300 negative cases. Lastly, AP-PCR analysis of 306 confirmed and convalescent cases revealed prolonged presence of viral loading for >20 days after the first positive diagnosis.

Whilst the lungs are the primary site of infection for SARS-CoV-2, in more severe cases its effects can be detected in multiple organ systems. Indeed, many COVID-19 positive patients develop cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial injury, myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmia, and thromboembolism, which are associated with higher mortality. Drug and cell therapies targeting immunosuppression have been suggested to help combat the cytokine storm.

The human immune system has not previously encountered this virus, raising the important question as to whether or not protective immunity is generated by infection. Growing evidence suggests that protective immunity can indeed be acquired post-infection—although a handful of reinfection cases have been reported. However, it is still unknown whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to some degree of long-lasting protection against the disease or the infection. This review draws insights from previous knowledge regarding the nature and longevity of immunity to the related virus, SARS-CoV, to fill the gaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Deciphering the immunological characteristics that give rise to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to guiding vaccine development and also predicting the course of the pandemic. Here we discuss the recent evidence that characterises the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its potential implications for the generation of memory responses and long-term protection."

S proteins bind with high affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (Li, 2016). Viral S protein consists of two regions S1 and S2, S1 is used for the binding to host cell receptor, whereas S2 is used for membrane fusion. After binding with receptors, virus particles enter into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis involving host cell receptors and endosomes (Gui et al., 2017). Once it comes inside the cell, it synthesizes viral polyproteins that encode for the replicase-transcriptase complex. After that, the virus synthesizes its RNA via RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Structural proteins are synthesized, which leads to the assembly and release of viral particles (Chen et al., 2020d; Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Fung and Liu, 2014). S protein binding to the ACE2 receptor in the case of SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 has been documented to induce a negative feedback loop, which ultimately results in the downregulation of ACE2 expression. The drop in ACE2 then directs its substrate angiotensin I to increase its related enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Fung and Liu, 2014).",Published online 2021 Jan 9.,"Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with the occurrence of repeat waves of infection frequently stretching hospital resources beyond capacity. Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19 transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35% VH2O2) used alone or combined with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm2) and moist heat (60 °C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing, and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60 °C for 60 min (such as, use of domestic washing machine and spin dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste management."

Most had metastasized disease (10/28) and many of them had lung cancer (7/28). The major causes of death were adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, septic shock and acute myocardial infarction [32], [33]. Liang et al [34] found that patients with cancer often had more severe morbidity (defined as the composite of admission to the intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation or death): severe events occurred in 7 (39%) of 18 patients with cancer compared to 124 (8%) of 1,572 patients without cancer (P = .0003). Particularly patients who had undergone chemotherapy or cancer surgery in the past month were at greater risk (3 [75%] of 4 patients) versus those who had not (6 [43%] of 14 patients; odds ratio [OR] = 5.34, P = .0026 in an analysis adjusting for risk factors including age, smoking history and other comorbidities). In multivariate analysis, cancer history was also associated with the highest risk for severe events (OR = 5.399, P = .003). Similar high mortality rates were reported in small series on hematological patients in China and cancer patients in Northern Italy [28], [35]. In a multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536 age-matched non-cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 it was shown that COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher likelihood in all severe outcomes (mortality OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.15–4.77). Patients with hematological cancers, lung cancer, or metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of major adverse events [36]. In a large Italian study looking at 9280 patients with PCR-confirmed CARS-CoV-2 infection [37] 9.5% of the men had a cancer diagnosis (prostate 28%, kidney/bladder 17%, colorectal 15%, leukemia/lymphoma 11%, lung 3%)). There were no data published for women with cancer in that study. Men with cancer were more frequently hospitalized and had a higher mortality compared to non-cancer males (respectively 67.9% vs 47% and 17.4% vs 6.9%). Strikingly, prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation treatment had a significantly lower probability to develop a clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection then other cancer patients (OR: 5.17; 95% CI 2.02–13.40) which may be explained by downregulation of the TMPRSS2 expression (see below).

The DRC recently controlled its tenth Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, but COVID-19 and a new EVD outbreak beginning on June 1, 2020 in the northwest Équateur Province have added an additional burden to health services. Although the epidemiology and transmission of EVD and COVID-19 differ, leveraging the public health infrastructures and experiences from coordinating the EVD response to guide the public health response to COVID-19 is critical. Building on the DRC’s 40 years of experience with 10 previous EVD outbreaks, we highlight the DRC’s multi-sectoral public health approach to COVID-19, which includes community-based screening, testing, contact-tracing, risk communication, community engagement, and case management. We also highlight remaining challenges and discuss the way forward for achieving control of both COVID-19 and EVD in the DRC."

As of July 19, 2020, there have been 14,043,176 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 597,583 (4.26%) deaths reported to the World Health Organization [4]. The early identification and isolation of patients with COVID-19 to prevent the transmission of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the community are vital for curbing the pandemic. However, the identification of patients with COVID-19 is challenging because of its broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical illness requiring intensive care [3,5]. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay directly amplifies and detects SARS-CoV-2-specific viral nucleic acid sequences and has been an important and irreplaceable diagnostic tool for COVID-19 detection. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of qRT-PCR assay is influenced significantly by the timing of specimen collection during the disease course, site of specimen collection, and skill required during specimen collection [6,7]. It is therefore plausible that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 failed to be diagnosed using qRT-PCR [8,9].",Published online 2020 Jun 10.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all nations to take an active role in infection control incorporating recommendations and measures to control viral dissemination.

Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2–infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes.

The difference in the number of cases reported by gender increases progressively in favor of male subjects up to the age group ≥60–69 (66.6%) and ≥70–79 (66.1%). Through literature search and analysis, we also found that men are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women. In addition, men with COVID-19 have a higher mortality rate than women. Male represents 73% of deaths in China, 59% in South Korea, and 61.8% in the United States. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of COVID-19, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets, direct and indirect contact. Genomic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is 79% identical to SARS-CoV, and both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for invading cells. In addition, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) can enhance ACE2-mediated virus entry. However, SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity with human ACE2, and its consequences are more serious than other coronaviruses. ACE2 acts as a “gate” for viruses to invade cells and is closely related to the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Studies have found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the testis and male reproductive tract and are regulated by testosterone. Mature spermatozoon even has all the machinery required to bind SARS-CoV-2, and these considerations raise the possibility that spermatozoa could act as potential vectors of this highly infectious disease. This review summarizes the gender differences in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and proposes the possible mechanism of orchitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential transmission route of the virus.

When TLRs recognize structurally conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) they recruit intracytoplasmic TIR domains and specific adaptors such as MyD88, TIRAP and TRIF to control intracellular signaling pathways leading to the synthesis and secretion of appropriate cytokines and chemokines by cells of the immune system (Takeda and Akira, 2004). Among the TLR family, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are predominantly localized in intracellular compartments and form the key gatekeepers in detecting and combating viral infections (Akira and Hemmi, 2003). TLR3 is activated by viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA), whereas TLR7 and 8 recognize viral single stranded RNA (ssRNA) and bacterial RNA. TLR9 recognizes RNA and DNA motifs that are rich in unmethylated Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sequences. CpG-motifs are higher expressed in the bacterial and viral genome compared to the vertebrate genome (Hemmi et al., 2000). TLRs can also be activated by endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which is believed to have a function in both immune system alert and tissue homeostasis (Bianchi, 2007; Kono and Rock, 2008). Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), evolutionary derived from endosymbiont bacteria, contains unmethylated CpG-motifs and is an example of a well-known DAMP that triggers inflammatory responses directly via TLR9 during injury and/or infection (Zhang et al., 2010). In the setting of COVID-19, multiple TLRs are likely relevant in viral combat and investigations of TLRs as therapeutic target are starting to emerge. Control of the cytokine storm by means of immunomodulators, including TLR7 and TLR8 antagonists and inhibitors of cellular mediators downstream of TLRs such as recombinant human IL-6 monoclonal antibody have been proposed and are currently under clinical investigation (Ye et al., 2020; Felsenstein et al., 2020; Lythgoe and Middleton, 2020; Poulas et al., 2020; Patra et al., 2020). Moreover, the TLR7 agonist, Imiquimod, is proposed as candidate to manage early stage COVID-19 patients (Angelopoulou et al., 2020). The effectiveness of TLR9 agonists for the use as vaccine adjuvants has also been suggested (Oberemok et al., 2020).In contrast to the available papers that more broadly focus on TLR3, 7 and 8, the here presented work, elaborates specifically on the role of TLR9 in defense against SARS-CoV-2 and introduces the hypothetical positioning of exaggerated TLR9 activation in severe COVID-19 pathology. The hypothesis is in line with our previously proposed synergistic disease driving effect of TLR9 agonists in the setting of COPD (Bezemer et al., 2012). TLR9 is broadly expressed on different cell types including epithelial cells in the lungs and nasal mucosa, in muscles and brains, on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, megakaryocytes and platelets, T lymphocytes, and NK cells (Hornung et al., 2002; Hayashi et al., 2003; Cognasse et al., 2005; Roda et al., 2005; Fransson et al., 2007; Kabelitz, 2007) A link between TLR9 activation and disease progression in COVID-19 is not directly obvious, since clinical investigations regarding safety and efficacy of inhaled TLR9 agonists in humans reported normal vital signs and no serious adverse effects although some “subtle” effects including moderate nature of flue like adverse events such as chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia and fever have been shown but are considered acceptable (Jackson et al., 2018). On the other hand, TLR9 activation in the airways in mice using high dose CpG-motifs, does lead to inflammation in the airways, ARDS, and sepsis (Knuefermann et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 1997). Moreover, genetic mutations leading to TLR9 gain of function in human is associated with immune-mediated disease and with a higher incidence of ICU acquired infection (Chatzi et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2010). The TLR9 COVID-19 hypothesis proposes that in specific vulnerable patients, activation of TLR9 could be a silent but driving force explaining the worsening of hyperinflammation and thrombotic complications caused by SARS-CoV-2. Positioning TLR9 in COVID-19 pathology, could explain multi-organ complications and aligns with the fact that only a relatively small proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe symptoms requiring ICU. Figure 1 depicts a set of circumstances and a mechanism of action of the proposed contribution of TLR9 to severe COVID-19 pathology in vulnerable patients. It should be noted that the TLR9 COVID-19 hypothesis does not rule out relevance of other TLRs in COVID-19 but rather highlights that disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, could have a worse outcome in people that are A) less well equipped to clear the virus, B) have to deal with a lot of available TLR9 stimuli over a longer period of time and, C) have high expression of functionally active TLR9. This hypothesis is relevant because it can be translated into a multifaceted window of opportunity for existing TLR9 modulating drug candidates that, depending on the disease stage, initially could stimulate, but later on preferably inhibit the TLR9 pathway in vulnerable patients. Moreover TLR9 expression levels and presence of TLR9 ligands are measurable and could potentially provide biomarkers for better identification of a group of individuals at risk for developing a more severe outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. High TLR9 expression levels can result from either genetic predisposition, people are simply born with it, or TLR9 expression is upregulated due to underlying health conditions, which will be explained further in the next sections. Examples of synergistically acting triggers for TLR9 include CpG-motifs from co-infecting pathogens, inhaled bioaerosols and organic dust, and cigarette smoke (Bezemer et al., 2012; Bauer et al., 2013; Martinez-Colon et al., 2019; Sun and Metzger, 2019). On top of the previously mentioned mtDNA, released from damaged host cells, also altered self-ligands, called carboxy-alkyl-pyrrole protein adducts (CAPs), that are generated during oxidative stress, are known to aggravate TLR9/MyD88 pathway activation (Zhang et al., 2010; Panigrahi et al., 2013). CAPs have been shown to promote platelet activation, granule secretion, and aggregation in vitro and thrombosis in vivo (Panigrahi et al., 2013). It is interesting to note that circulating mtDNA levels increase with age which is a familiar trait contributing to chronic inflammation, so called “inflamm-aging” in elderly people (Pinti et al., 2014). This TLR9 axis of inflamm-aging could have relevance in the context of COVID-19 where older age is associated with greater risk of development of severe complications of COVID-19. Figure 2 provides a summarizing overview of insight from different disciplines that reason the hypothesis that TLR9 specifically could have a key role in disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Further clarification is provided in the next sections.",Published online 2020 Dec 11.,"The new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) emerged in 2019 and hence is often referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component.

Dysfunctional endothelial cells can promote chronic inflammation and disease processes like thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and lung injury. In endothelial cells, mitochondria regulate these inflammatory pathways via redox signaling, which is primarily achieved through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Excess mtROS causes oxidative stress that can initiate and exacerbate senescence, a state that promotes inflammation and chronic endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress can also activate feedback loops that perpetuate mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS overproduction, and inflammation. In this review, we provide an overview of phenotypes mediated by mtROS in endothelial cells – such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and senescence – as well as how these chronic states may be initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells. We also propose that SARS-CoV-2 activates mtROS-mediated feedback loops that cause long-term changes in host redox status and endothelial function, promoting cardiovascular disease and lung injury after recovery from COVID-19.

In particular, cardiovascular (CV) cells (e.g., endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes) could be directly infected and indirectly disturbed by systemic alterations, leading to hyperinflammatory, apoptotic, thrombotic, and vasoconstrictive responses. Until now, hundreds of clinical trials are testing antivirals and immunomodulators to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection or related systemic anomalies. However, new therapies targeting the CV system might reduce the severity and lethality of disease. In this line, activation of the non-canonical pathway of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could improve CV homeostasis under COVID-19. In particular, treatments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) may help to reduce hyperinflammation and viral propagation, while infusion of soluble ACE2 may trap plasma viral particles and increase cardioprotective Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7) peptides. The association of specific ACE2 polymorphisms with increased susceptibility of infection and related CV pathologies suggests potential genetic therapies. Moreover, specific agonists of Ang-(1–7) receptor could counter-regulate the hypertensive, hyperinflammatory, and hypercoagulable responses. Interestingly, sex hormones could also regulate all these RAAS components.

Many drugs have been screened, and even their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. Amongst these RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and remdesivir) and steroids especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The biological agents like tocilizumab, interferons, and convalescent plasma prove to be beneficial in viral clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S protein targeting vaccines have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment of various in vitro and in vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally help the current research.

It is difficult to make a projection of the final outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is still developing, but the currently available data are staggering (as of 4 September 2020): there are almost 26.8 million COVID-19 cases in 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, with more than 877,000 patients died. Although current statistics indicate that 3.3% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected have died worldwide, the COVID-19 mortality rates are not equal in all affected territories and vary in a wide range in different countries (from 0.56% in Iceland to >18% in France). Of these six global outbreaks of viral infections, three were caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19), of which COVID-19 is characterized by the most efficient and aggressive transmission. In fact, COVID-19, which is caused by the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019 new CoV, 2019-nCoV), is spreading like wildfire worldwide, affecting almost every country in the world. Taken together, both previous outbreaks of other members of the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) did not produce even 1% of the global harm already inflicted by COVID-19. Furthermore, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (all are β-CoVs of the B and C lineage), there are four other coronaviruses (CoVs) capable of infecting humans (HCoVs), which circulate continuously in the human population. These are HCoV-OC43 [1,2] and HCoV-HKU1 [3] (β-CoVs of the A lineage or β1CoVs), and HCoV-229E [4,5] and HCoV-NL63 [6,7] (α-CoVs).

The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets.

This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the “3 Cs,” namely, “closed spaces with poor ventilation,” “crowded spaces with many people,” and “close contact.” In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings as one of the initial political actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of indoor environmental quality control, especially ventilation."

Reliable and easily deployed testing is necessary to fully understand the spread of the virus. Among these, antibody assays make up a critical arm of our testing capacity that will allow for large-scale serum surveillance and closer monitoring of immunity in individual patients (3–6).

Coronavirus contains positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ve ssRNA) as its genetic material, which can be about 30 kb in length and is mostly protected by an outer fatty layer of an envelope that also helps the virus to evade host immune response and assists its entry inside the host cell (11, 12). The subfamily Coronavirinae is further subdivided into four genera, namely alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta- coronavirus (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV, and δ-CoV). Viruses having the potential to infect humans are placed under the genus α-CoV and β-CoV (SARS-CoV & MERS-CoV), whereas viruses of γ-CoV and δ-CoV genera are mostly known to infect avians and pigs (13). The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 falls under the genus β-CoV, as it shares 88% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses (derived from bat) but is only 79% identical to SARS-CoV and 50% identical to MERS-CoV (3). Thus, it can be deduced by its genome identity that the immediate host of this virus could be a bat, which then transmitted it to some unknown intermediate host that acted as a source for the transmission of the virus to humans.",Published online 2020 Oct 1.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) viruses spread unscrupulously virtually every corner on the planet in a very quick speed leading to an unprecedented world pandemic of COVID‐19 claiming a great many of people’s life.

Other than that, to learn the main characteristic of host immunity responding to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is an eminent task for restraining virus and controlling disease progress. Beside antibody production in response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, host cellular immunity plays an indispensable role in impeding virus replication and expansion at various stages of COVID‐19 disease. In this review, we summarized the recent knowledge regarding the aberrant regulation and dysfunction of multiple immune cells during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This includes the dysregulation of immune cell number, Th polarity, cytokine storm they implicated with, as well as cell function exhaustion after chronic virus stimulation. Notwithstanding that many obstacles remain to be overcome, studies on immunotherapy for COVID‐19 treatment based on the known features of host immunity in response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection offer us tangible benefits and hope for making this SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic under control."

SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus appearance in human history following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2, 3). Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped viruses encoded by a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and named for the crown-like appearance of their virions under the electron microscope. The key feature of SARS-CoV-2 that differentiates it from other viruses is its transmissibility combined with a greater risk of mortality due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections range from mild/ asymptomatic infections (20-86% of all infections), restricted to the upper respiratory tract (20–86% of all infections), to severe respiratory distress characterized by the spread of infection to the lower airways leading to regional inflammation and pneumonia. This is manifested particularly in patients with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (4, 5).

The severity of the disease in diagnosed patients has broad variations ranging from asymptomatic carriers, or mild cases needing supportive care, to severe cases requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [2]. The patients with symptom onset are reported to be most contagious and to shed the virus [3]. However, as clinical testing capacities increase, numbers of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases keep skyrocketing. This jeopardizes proper screening and transmission-control. This especially poses a serious challenge since governments and regulatory bodies relax stay-at-home orders and reopen partially. In some cases, decision-makers are being forced to revert their reopening plans on account of increasing case numbers. Surveillance and largescale accessible diagnostics always play an important part to curb the spread of infectious pathogens and reduce mortality during an outbreak such as this [4,5]. During past outbreaks, the lack of a rapid and simple serological test limited past infection tracing and assessment of overall health impacts. A reliable immunoglobulin (antibody)-based surveillance plan that can detect even past and non-active infections can help understand community spread dynamics and the level of susceptibility in a specific population or region [6]. These tests detect the presence of specific proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins produced in response to antigen/s of the pathogen [7]. Moreover, antibody-based diagnostic tests at mass scale can help gather epidemiological data on infected cases, and track them for possible COVID-19 associated complications such as cardiovascular [8,9,10,11], neurological [12,13,14,15], and other unknown pathophysiological conditions [16].",Published online 2020 Dec 28.,"Preventing the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 is an unsolved challenge. The involvement of T cell immunity in this exacerbation remains unclear. To identify predictive markers of COVID-19 progress and outcome, we analyzed peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19-associated ARDS patients and 35 mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, not requiring intensive care. Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-reactive T cells between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein-reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose the CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker."

Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mainly causes respiratory disease, it might result in renal insufficiency and multi-organ failure (MOF) in serious cases [2]. High ACE2 expression was identified in both renal proximal tubular cells and bladder urothelial cells [3]. On the other hand, CKD patients or renal transplant recipients experience a clinically greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection and acuteness. In addition, researchers have reported frequent renal failure and greater occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (Table 1 ) [4, 5]. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of renal failure upon admission and the progression of AKI during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients was high and this was associated with increased inpatient mortality [6]. Moreover, male gender and kidney disease independently correlated with higher mortality risk, suggesting renal function must be particularly monitored in order to efficiently control the disease [7, 8, 9].",null,COVID-19 mortality is strongly associated with the development of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with the worst outcome resulting in cytokine release syndrome and multiorgan failure. It is becoming critically important to identify at the early stage of the infection those patients who are prone to develop the most adverse effects.

As suggested by the recent reports regarding the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), upon entry into the host, this virus binds to the extracellular domain of ACE2 in nasal, lung, and gut epithelial cells through its spike glycoprotein subunit S1. We put forth the hypothesis that during this process, reduced ACE2 could result in clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients with diabetes via aggravating Ang-II–dependent pathways and partly driving not only lung but also bone marrow and gastrointestinal pathology. In addition to systemic RAS, the pathophysiological response of the local RAS within the intestinal epithelium involves mechanisms distinct from that of RAS in the lung; however, both lung and gut are impacted by diabetes-induced bone marrow dysfunction. Careful targeting of the systemic and tissue RAS may optimize clinical outcomes in subjects with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2."

Optimal immunological homeostasis is achieved when the pathogen is removed with high efficiency while avoiding collateral tissue damage for the host (Holt et al., 2008). This immunological balance is different between women and men. Increasing data demonstrate that women mount stronger immune responses against viruses and vaccines (Flanagan et al., 2017; Klein and Flanagan, 2016; Ziegler and Altfeld, 2017) and also exhibit superior immune-mediated tissue repair capacities (Vom Steeg and Klein, 2019). The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic highlights the clinical consequences of these sex differences in antiviral immunity and tissue resilience (Klein et al., 2020; Scully et al., 2020), with older men in particular suffering from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and experiencing higher case mortality rates (Docherty et al., 2020; Grasselli et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Salje et al., 2020). Compiled data from Europe, for example, show male to female ratios of 1.5 for COVID-19 hospitalizations and of 1.7 to 1.8 for COVID-19 case fatality rates (Gebhard et al., 2020). Although sex differences in manifestations of viral infections have been established for multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV, hepatitis C virus, Zika virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), and influenza virus (Baden et al., 2014; Gabriel and Arck, 2014; Klein and Flanagan, 2016; Mazur et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2011; Stanelle-Bertram et al., 2018; van Lunzen and Altfeld, 2014), sex-specific treatment strategies are rarely applied outside the field of oncology. However, sex differences in case fatality rates seem to be higher in COVID-19 than in these other infections (Gebhard et al., 2020), emphasizing the need to develop treatment strategies for COVID-19 that take these differences between the sexes into account. Indeed, in response to the urgency of the COVID-19 health crisis, sex-based treatment options in COVID-19 patients, including the use of estrogen, estrogen antagonists, and androgen antagonists (NCT04359329, NCT04397718, NCT04374279, and NCT04389580), are currently being tested and planned. However, given the complexities underlying sex-specific differences in infectious diseases, ranging from environmental to biological factors, such as differences in sex hormones and expression of X-chromosome-encoded genes, supplementing men with female hormones might not be the final answer. The rapidly expanding knowledge on the differential regulation of antiviral immunity and immune-mediated tissue repair pathways between women and men needs to be harnessed for the design and testing of novel treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection aimed at enhancing antiviral immunity, preventing pathological immune activation, and strengthening tissue resilience. Here, we discuss biological pathways that provide women advantages over men in achieving immunological homeostasis in response to viral infections and address their potential implications for the treatment of severe COVID-19.",null,

Besides SARS-CoV-2 virus lung tropism causing an atypical severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2], evidence is documented about the involvement of several other organs, including the cardiovascular system. About 20–40% of hospitalized patients manifest a wide spectrum of symptoms related to heart injury, ranging from mild chest discomfort, palpitations, and arrhythmias to cardiogenic shock and fulminant heart failure [3]. Furthermore, myocardial injury has been documented in more than 50% of deceased patients [4] with up to 7% of COVID-19 related deaths being linked to myocarditis [5]. To date, it is not clearly understood whether the cause of the cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 patients is due to SARS-CoV-2 direct cell damage or is rather secondary to the excessive immune system reaction. The systemic hyper-inflammatory status may act as a trigger for an aberrant host immune response mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes [6]. Inflammation-mediated leucocyte adhesion molecules on the endothelium may cause coronary dysfunction with ischemia [7] or acute coronary syndrome [8]. Alternatively, ARDS-induced hypoxia associated with systemic sepsis, fever, and hypotension may lead to myocardial injury [7,9] due to the oxygen supply and demand imbalance. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in vascular endothelial cells of patients affected by endotheliitis [10] and in cardiac macrophages of COVID-19 patients with cardiogenic shock and myocarditis [11,12]. Moreover, viral RNA has been previously reported in COVID-19 patients’ whole heart tissue [13,14], regardless of a cardiac phenotype [15,16]. The cell invasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly mediated by ACE2 receptor [17], which is highly expressed by several cardiac cell types, such as pericytes [18], cardiomyocytes [19], and endothelial cells [10,20]. Nonetheless, immunohistochemistry for viral antigen detection in cardiomyocytes has never been shown [21,22].",Published online 2020 May 12.,

RNA chaperones are usually nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins, which have long disordered structures that promote RNA molecules to adjust conformational changes. For example, coronavirus nucleoproteins (N protein) have RNA chaperone activity and function as an RNA chaperone, which could help template switching [32,33,34]. In addition, recent studies demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylates the N protein of SARS-CoV and further inhibition of GSK3 can effectively inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV [35]. Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is involved in the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the host cells. Importantly, it has been shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV had binding ability to human hnRNP A1 with high affinity by using kinetic analyses with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach. These studies suggest that hnRNPA1 is able to bind to SARS-CoV N protein to form a replication/transcription complex and control viral RNA synthesis [36].",Published online 2020 Sep 14.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the pandemic of the century, with approximately 3.5 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020. Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory milieu and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications. COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased use of health care services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection. Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and cardiovascular implications of COVID-19, its impact on existing pathways of care, the role of modern technologies to tackle the pandemic, and a proposal of novel management algorithms for the most common acute cardiac conditions."

Many coronaviruses are zoonotic, spreading the disease from animals to humans (Mohammadi et al., 2020). It is a severe illness that has a high attack rate and case fatality rate around the globe. To combat this dramatic situation of COVID-19, our team has provided the importance of Indian traditional medicine as therapeutic approach for COVID-19 (Balachandar et al., 2020a). Previously, after the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, there was an important question that needed to be answered: will patients recovering from SARS have any re-infection chances? Since the SARS (2002−2003) outbreak, no vaccine has been developed so far, but plenty of people have recovered from this infection, and several follow-up studies have been conducted to check their health status (Tang et al., 2011). According to a previous report, it is possible that ongoing active alveolitis during the host immune system response to the SARS-CoV antigen might lead to pulmonary fibrosis in some patients after recovery (Hui et al., 2005). Das et al. (2015) analysed 55 patients who recovered from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and found that after 1-year, lesions were present in the periphery of the lungs. Even with such a huge mortality rate, there is hope that the COVID-19 patients will recover from this deadly situation. Hospitals and doctors may find it impossible to offer follow-up checks and investigate reinfection and it will be highly beneficial for hospitals and patients if this can be outsourced. At this situation, researchers should overtake their responsibility for regular follow-up survey of COVID-19 recovered patients in the convalescent phase which would be helpful to evaluate any changes in the acquired immune function, blood parameters, psychological factors, biochemical factors, lung, brain, eye, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract functions over the course of time. The drug chloroquine repurposed from a malarial drug has been utilized for COVID-19 and Hydroxychloroquine reduces the pH levels and can interfere with viral replication (Chen et al., 2020).",null,null

Most of the initial cases of COVID-19 were linked to exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals, including bats and snakes, are traded. Though the market was closed soon, many people who had close contact with a patient or a history of travel to Wuhan were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 and had symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea (Huang et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020). Since its rapid spread in China and many other countries, COVID-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30th January 2020. Later, the WHO formally named the disease COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, and the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy named the virus SARS-CoV-2 instead of 2019-nCoV on the same day (Gorbalenya et al., 2020); however, this new name was opposed by a group of virologists in China for its misleadingness and confusion (Jiang et al., 2020).",Published online 2020 Sep 11.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spread rapidly across the globe infecting millions of people and causing significant health and economic impacts. Authorities are exploring complimentary approaches to monitor this infectious disease at the community level. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal wastewater are being implemented worldwide as an environmental surveillance approach to inform health authority decision-making. Owing to the extended excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool, WBE can surveil large populated areas with a longer detection window providing unique information on the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that are unlikely to be screened by clinical testing. Herein, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 63) from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia from 24th of February to 1st of May 2020. A total of 21 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 135 to 11,992 gene copies (GC)/100 mL of wastewater. Detections were made in a Southern Brisbane WWTP in late February 2020, up to three weeks before the first clininal case was reported there. Wastewater samples were generally positive during the period with highest caseload data. The positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater while there were limited clinical reported cases demonstrates the potential of WBE as an early warning system to identify hotspots and target localised public health responses, such as increased individual testing and the provision of health warnings."

New SARS-CoV-2 informatics (structure, strains, like-cycles, functional sites) motivated bio-pharma experts to investigate novel therapeutic agents that act to recognize, inhibit, and knockdown combinations of drugs, vaccines, and antibodies, have been optimized to manage COVID-19. However, successful targeted delivery of these agents to avoid off-targeting and unnecessary drug ingestion is very challenging.

CoVs are named for the spike proteins that are shaped like crowns on the surface of the virus (Y. Chen et al., 2020). The avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) was the earliest CoV isolated in 1937(Cavanagh, 2005); human CoVs (HCoVs) were first discovered in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966) (Fig. 1A). CoVs belong to the very large Coronaviridae family of viruses, which is classified into four genera according to their genetic information as follows: Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV), Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV) (Forni et al., 2017). The α-CoVs include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, whereas the β-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-Hong Kong University 1 (HCoV-HKU1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1B). Generally, α-CoVs and β-CoVs are limited to only infecting mammals, whereas γ-CoVs and δ-CoVs infect mostly birds but are capable of infecting mammals in some cases (Woo et al., 2012).

However, the advancement in medical science has made it possible to identify that the novel infectious agent is from the coronavirus family. Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun.

The main feature of SARS-CoV-2 that distinguishes it from other viruses is the speed of transmission combined with higher risk of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with diabetes mellitus (DM), severe obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension are more likely to get infected and are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Among elderly patients who are at higher risk of death from COVID-19, 26.8% have DM. Although the reasons for this increased risk are yet to be determined, several factors may contribute to type-2 DM patients’ increased susceptibility to infections. A possible factor that may play a role in increasing the risk in people affected by diabetes and/or obesity is the impaired innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation that can lead to abrupt systemic metabolic alteration.

In contrast to China, where only 20% of the deaths were older than 80 years, octogenarians and nonagenarians account in Europe for almost two-thirds of the mortality.

Increased mass testing and surveillance are crucial for controlling the disease spread, obtaining better pandemic statistics, and developing realistic epidemiological models. Despite the advantages of nucleic acid- and antigen-based tests such as accuracy, specificity, and non-invasive approaches of sample collection, they can only detect active infections. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are produced by the host immune system within a few days after infection and persist in the blood for at least several weeks after infection resolution. Antibody-based tests have provided a substitute and effective method of ultra-rapid detection for multiple contagious disease outbreaks in the past, including viral diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Thus, although not highly suitable for early diagnosis, antibody-based methods can be utilized to detect past infections hidden in the population, including asymptomatic ones. In an active community spread scenario of a disease that can provide a bigger window for mass detections and a practical approach for continuous surveillance. These factors encouraged researchers to investigate means of improving antibody-based rapid tests and employ them as reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific, and economic tools for COVID-19 mass testing and surveillance. The development and integration of such immunoglobulin-based tests can transform the pandemic diagnosis by moving the same out of the clinics and laboratories into community testing sites and homes. This review discusses the principle, technology, and strategies being used in antibody-based testing at present. It also underlines the immense prospect of immunoglobulin-based testing and the efficacy of repeated planned deployment in pandemic management and post-pandemic sustainable screenings globally."

The objective of this review is to identify and appraise the available evidence (clinical trials and laboratory studies on masks and respirators, epidemiological studies, and air sampling studies), clarify key concepts and necessary conditions for airborne transmission, and shed light on knowledge gaps in the field. We find that, except for aerosol-generating procedures, the overall data in support of airborne transmission—taken in its traditional definition (long-distance and respirable aerosols)—are weak, based predominantly on indirect and experimental rather than clinical or epidemiological evidence. Consequently, we propose a revised and broader definition of “airborne,” going beyond the current droplet and aerosol dichotomy and involving short-range inhalable particles, supported by data targeting the nose as the main viral receptor site. This new model better explains clinical observations, especially in the context of close and prolonged contacts between health care workers and patients, and reconciles seemingly contradictory data in the SARS-CoV-2 literature.

The OpenSAFELY study further noted an approximate log–linear relationship between risk of COVID-19-related death and age, indicating that the risk of COVID-19 mortality progressively increases over the spectrum of the human lifespan3. Although the OpenSAFELY cohort excluded patients under the age of 18, other lines of evidence have extended these conclusions to younger populations.

The pathway is consistent with a broad range of observed clinical features and biological markers and captures key mediators of pathophysiology. In this proposed pathway, membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus via ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary type-II pneumocytes, provoke an initial immune response featuring inflammatory cytokine production coupled with a weak interferon response, particularly in IFN-λ–dependent epithelial defense. Differentiation of non-classic pathogenic T-cells and pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes contributes to a skewed inflammatory profile, mediated by membrane-bound immune receptor subtypes (e.g., FcγRIIA) and downstream signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB p65 and p38 MAPK), followed by chemotactic infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissue. Endothelial barrier degradation and capillary leakage contribute to alveolar cell damage. Inflammatory cytokine release, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and NETosis contribute to pulmonary thrombosis and cytokine storm. These mechanisms are concordant with observed clinical markers in COVID-19, including high expression of inflammatory cytokines on the TNF-α/IL-6 axis, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), diffuse alveolar damage via cell apoptosis in respiratory epithelia and vascular endothelia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP, high production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), depressed platelet count, and thrombosis. Although certain elements are likely to be revised as new findings emerge, the proposed pathway suggests multiple points of investigation for potential therapeutic interventions. Initial candidate interventions include prophylaxis to augment epithelial defense (e.g., AT1 receptor blockade, type III and type I interferons, melatonin, calcitriol, camostat, and lopinavir) and to reduce viral load (e.g., remdesivir, ivermectin, emetine, Abelson kinase inhibitors, dopamine D2 antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators). Additional interventions focus on tempering inflammatory signaling and injury (e.g., dexamethasone, doxycycline, Ang1-7, estradiol, alpha blockers, and DHA/EPA, pasireotide), as well as inhibitors targeted toward molecular mediators of the maladaptive COVID-19 immune response (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17, JAK, and CDK9)."

The genome sequence of this 2019-nCoV was confirmed to be structurally related to other CoVs, including 89% identical to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-like CoV) and 82% identical to human SARS-CoV-1; thus, the virus was renamed SARS-CoV-2 7, 8, 9. SARS-CoV-2 is also similar to other zoonotic CoVs causing global outbreaks of severe respiratory illnesses, such as SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and has been confirmed to be transmitted from human to human [10].",null,"The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified and monitored daily for development of symptoms (active monitoring). Selected close contacts (including those with exposures categorized as higher risk) were targeted for collection of additional exposure information and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four hundred four close contacts were actively monitored in the jurisdictions that managed the travel-related cases.

TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4."

Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the “cytokine storm” that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations.

At first, COVID-19 began in China, but presently, it has spread very fast, and the infection has reached different territories and regions of the world, which is causing fear, health, psychological, and socio-economic problems among the world’s population.7 On a daily basis, confirmed COVID-19 cases and death tolls from the infection are soaring at unimaginable numbers globally.7-9 The world is faced with containing and controlling the massive spread of the infection; consequently, the aim of this review is to provide detailed explanation on the facts, fears, and appropriate preventive measures against COVID-19.",Published online 2020 May 15.,"COVID-19 disease, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is related to a series of physiopathological mechanisms that mobilize a wide variety of biomolecules, mainly immunological in nature. In the most severe cases, the prognosis can be markedly worsened by the hyperproduction of mainly proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, preferentially targeting lung tissue. This study reviews published data on alterations in the expression of different cytokines in patients with COVID-19 who require admission to an intensive care unit. Data on the implication of cytokines in this disease and their effect on outcomes will support the design of more effective approaches to the management of COVID-19."

The first known case in the U.S. was confirmed on January 21, 2020. In February, SARS-CoV-2 testing remained limited due to flawed test kits. For the first few months of the pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that physicians prioritize testing hospitalized patients, who tend to have moderate to severe symptoms. Most state testing policies were consistent with this recommendation (Supplementary Table 1). Yet, evidence from studies that conducted broader testing suggest that 30–70% of individuals who test positive have mild or no symptoms1–4 and that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-25–7. Thus, a substantial number of mild or asymptomatic infections in the U.S. may be undetected8. Furthermore, initial evidence suggests that tests based on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs may produce false negative results9–12. Thus, counts of confirmed cases are biased due to incomplete testing and imperfect test sensitivity. Accurate estimates of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical to understanding the course of the pandemic and informing public health response8,13. Furthermore, limited and biased testing can influence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, which typically rely upon observed counts of cumulative infections14.",Published online 2020 Dec 4.,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a tester of the immune system.

The averse economic effect of certain disease control measures such as national lock-downs and social distancing, though beneficial, makes them unsustainable. Worse still is the fact that wild animals and domestic pets are carriers of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that the disease would take longer than expected to be eradicated globally.

The high prevalence of old age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease in patients who develop a severe to critical COVID-19 syndrome suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and an impaired innate immune response promote the development by the viral infection of an acute endothelialitis in the pulmonary microcirculation complicated by abnormal vasoconstrictor responses, luminal plugging by inflammatory cells, and intravascular thrombosis. This endothelialitis extends into the systemic circulation what may lead to acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, and thromboembolic complications both in the arterial and venous circulation.

This strategy is employed through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 beta coronaviruses’ binding and utilization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (reviewed in [1]). ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein expressed in epithelial and vascular endothelial cells in the lungs, intestines, heart, kidneys, brain, and other organs (reviewed in [2]). The classical function of ACE2 is the cleavage of peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Figure 1, reviewed in [3,4]). Ang II binds to Ang II receptor type I (AT1R) to control blood pressure, and multiple other responses [1] in barrier tissues expressing ACE2 (Figure 2A) [2]. The resulting ACE2 cleavage product Ang (1–7) mediates vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects through the MAS receptor (alias Mas1, MasR; reviewed in [5,6]) (Figure 2B), which counteracts the damaging effects of Ang II/AT1R (reviewed in [7]). Surprising findings in mice deficient in ACE2 (Ace2−/−) reveal that ACE2 does not directly control blood pressure [8] and has a gamut of functions that cannot be attributed merely to the cleavage of Ang II [9,10].

To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, including two α-CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and five Betacoronaviruses (β-CoVs) (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV [SARS-CoV], Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV], and most recently β-CoV SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19]) [5,6,7,8,9]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified COVID-19 as a β-CoV of group 2B [10]. CoVs cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in various animal species, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [11,12]. The β-CoV lineages HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 typically are associated with self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and the elderly [13,14]. Examination of the viral evolution reveals that bats and rodents are gene sources for most α-Covs and β-CoVs, whereas avian species are the proposed gene sources of most δ-CoVs and γ-CoVs [15]. CoVs often cross species barriers to infect humans and have emerged to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the general population. The most recent examples are SARS-CoV, emerging in China in 2002 with 8000 infections and 800 deaths [16,17,18], and MERS-CoV, emerging in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 [15,19,20]. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 evolution, Bat-CoV RaTG13, a bat CoV, is the closest known virus to SAR-CoV-2 and is predicted to have diverged 40–70 years ago [21]. The Pangolin-CoV shares 91.02% genome homology with SARS-CoV-2 and 90.55% genome homology with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and is the second closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 [22]. However, the exact identification of the zoonotic intermediate host for the evolutionary development of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and will require further investigation.",Published online 2020 Dec 8.,"COVID-19 outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus has become an urgent health and economic challenge. Diabetes is a risk factor for severity and mortality of COVID-19. Recent studies support that COVID-19 has effects beyond the respiratory tract, with vascular complications arising as relevant factors worsening its prognosis, then making patients with previous vascular disease more prone to severity or fatal outcome. Angiotensin-II converting enzime-2 (ACE2) has been proposed as preferred receptor for SARS-CoV-2 host infection, yet specific proteins participating in the virus entry are not fully known. SARS-CoV-2 might use other co-receptor or auxiliary proteins allowing virus infection. In silico experiments proposed that SARS-CoV-2 might bind dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26), which was established previously as receptor for MERS-CoV. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) component ACE2 and DPP4 are proteins dysregulated in diabetes. Imbalance of the RAAS and direct effect of soluble DPP4 exert deleterious vascular effects. We hypothesize that diabetic patients might be more affected by COVID-19 due to increased presence ACE2 and DPP4 mediating infection and contributing to a compromised vasculature. Here, we discuss the role of ACE2 and DPP4 as relevant factors linking the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 in diabetic patients and present an outlook on therapeutic potential of current drugs targeted against RAAS and DPP4 to treat or prevent COVID-19-derived vascular complications. Diabetes affects more than 400 million people worldwide, thus better understanding of how they are affected by COVID-19 holds an important benefit to fight against this disease with pandemic proportions."

Initially perceived as exclusively targeting the respiratory system, COVID-19 has been revealed as a complex, multiorgan disorder with a plethora of thomboinflammatory manifestations in key vital organs, including the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and brain [2]. The common denominator driving pathology in these organs appears to be an extensive and deregulated activation of innate immune pathways causing massive monocyte and neutrophil infiltration into infected tissues and a disseminated thromboinflammatory response of the microvascular endothelium (thrombotic microangiopathy) [4, 5, 6, 49]. This derailed inflammatory response, marked by a systemic increase in proinflammatory cytokines (known as cytokine storm) reflects a maladaptive host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that is instigated by pathogen recognition systems, such as the complement cascade, which become overwhelmingly active in their attempt to thwart the infectious agent [5, 7]. The lack of effective vaccines and the growing appreciation that a multitude of host immune factors contribute to infection risk, disease severity and therapeutic outcomes have galvanized efforts to develop tailored and stage-specific COVID-19 therapies exploiting several antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immune modulating treatments [8, 9, 10, 11].",Published online 2020 Apr 23.,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached pandemic status.

The coronavirus comprises of a capsid with single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA), which is allied with a nucleoprotein in matrix protein (Tyrrell and Myint, 1996). Like other SARS virus, the SARS-CoV-2 has three types of hosts (i.e. natural, intermediate, and final), leading to a great amount of difficulty in its prevention and treatment (Wang et al., 2020a).

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious (10−20 times more than SARS-CoV) as it can be transmitted mainly via airborne droplets of asymptomatic individuals and have much higher viral loads in the upper respiratory tract compared to SARS-CoV, regardless of the similarity in their surface and aerosol stability [4]. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to begin 2.5 days before and hit the peak 14 h prior to symptom onset [5].

In mild and severe cases, symptoms start with fever and cough, followed by dyspnea, and reaching a maximum approximately eight days after the first symptoms. Older adults, people with an immunosuppressive disease and pre-existing diagnosed chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of getting a severe infection, resulting in an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at usually two weeks after symptoms onset [6,7]. Hence, the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in controlling the spread of this highly contagious virus and decreases the fatality rate, which mostly affects high-risk people (Figure 1A) [5].

As such, not only are CD20‐depleting agents approved for B cell‐related cancers, but they are increasingly being used on‐ and off‐label in autoimmune diseases [1, 4]. Ocrelizumab has recently been licensed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), and antibodies including ofatumumab and ublituximab are in development for MS [5, 6, 7].

The beginning of the infection started from the Huanan seafood wholesale market, while the exact infection route of the first case remains unclear (Paules et al. 2020). In the early stages of the global COVID-19 spread, the cases identified outside of China were mostly travelers who were infected in China and then moved to areas outside of the country. From mid-February 2020, COVID-19 has begun to spread in South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency (WHO Coronavirus disease 2019a). On the March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has been defined as a pandemic (WHO Coronavirus disease 2019b). Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to all continents excluding Antarctica.

Although both SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 for host entry, distinct COVID-19 pathogenesis coincides with the acquisition of a new sequence, which is homologous to the furin cleavage site of the human epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). This review provides a comprehensive summary of the role of ACE2 in the assembly of Na+-dependent transporters of glucose, imino and neutral amino acids, as well as the functions of ENaC. Data support an osmotic adaptation mechanism in which osmotic and hemostatic instability induced by Ang II-activated ENaC is counterbalanced by an influx of organic osmolytes and Na+ through the ACE2 complex. We propose a paradigm for the two-site attack of SARS-CoV-2 leading to ENaC hyperactivation and inactivation of the ACE2 complex, which collapses cell osmolality and leads to rupture and/or necrotic death of swollen pulmonary, endothelial, and cardiac cells, thrombosis in infected and non-infected tissues, and aberrant sensory and neurological perception in COVID-19 patients. This dual mechanism employed by SARS-CoV-2 calls for combinatorial treatment strategies to address and prevent severe complications of COVID-19."

High risks for fatal disease in COVID‐19 include older age, metabolic syndrome, male gender, and individuals who develop delayed type I IFN response. HCQ acts by different mechanisms including prevention of cellular entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 and inhibition of type I IFN signaling. Recent controversies regarding efficacy of HCQ in management of COVID‐19 warrant more studies in that direction.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781281/,COVID-19 and Possible Pharmacological Preventive Options,"Viral infection, Respiratory infection, RNA virus","The COVID-19 pandemic and the fear that it has brought to the society have emphasized the need for a rapid scientific communication to increase knowledge about the virus itself and how it can be combated pharmacologically. Historically severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Table 1 [1-5]) is a descendant of the SARS-CoV, which was a virus that caused the first major pandemic of the new millennium [1-4]. The current SARS-CoV-2 infection has strong homology to the SARS-CoV virus that was responsible for the SARS pandemic in 2002 [2, 4, 5]. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory infection similar to that previously reported for SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV [2, 4, 5]. The initial symptoms are almost identical to other viral diseases, such as a common cold, influenza with fever, muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue [2, 4, 5]. The digestive tract is commonly involved in the viral infections and it is consequently also affected by these three closely related coronaviruses, so symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and back pain can also occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection [2, 4, 5]. The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world together with its severe and life-threatening respiratory infection has resulted in a situation that requires a rapid treatment strategy to save human lives, even if specific drug candidates are still missing [2, 4, 5]. An unusual feature of coronaviruses is that they can easily be conveyed between mammalian species as closely related coronaviruses could be found in bats, civets, camels, cows and humans [2, 4, 5]. Like many other viral infections targeting respiratory organs such as the flu, SARS, MERS-CoV as well as other airborne viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 spreads through tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth by infectious carriers via a cough. The released virus particles normally remain in the surrounding air for some time and can be a direct route of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 infection to other people through breathing. Released SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by infected subjects can also land on the surfaces around them, providing an additional path for the virus to spread.",null,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2/human/Wuhan/X1/2019, a virus belonging to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and the recognition of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic have highly increased the scientific research regarding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) seems to be involved in COVID-19 natural course, since studies suggest the membrane-bound Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) works as SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor. Besides the efforts of the scientific community to understand the virus’ molecular interactions with human cells, few studies summarize what has been so far discovered about SARS-CoV-2 signaling mechanisms and its interactions with RAS molecules. This review aims to discuss possible SARS-CoV-2 intracellular signaling pathways, cell entry mechanism and the possible consequences of the interaction with RAS components, including Angiotensin II (Ang II), Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Angiotensin II receptor type-1 (AT1), and Mas Receptor. We also discuss ongoing clinical trials and treatment based on RAS cascade intervention. Data were obtained independently by the two authors who carried out a search in the PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, Scopus, SciELO and the National Institute of Health databases using Medical Subject Heading terms as “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” “Renin Angiotensin System,” “ACE2,” “Angiotensin II,” “Angiotensin-(1-7),” and “AT1 receptor.” Similarly to other members of Coronaviridae family, the molecular interactions between the pathogen and the membrane-bound ACE2 are based on the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein (S) in two subunits. Following the binding of the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2, transmembrane protease/serine subfamily 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the S2 domain to facilitate membrane fusion. It is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry results in downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2, an enzyme that converts Ang II into Ang-(1-7). This mechanism can result in lung injury and vasoconstriction. In addition, Ang II activates pro-inflammatory cascades when binding to the AT1 Receptor. On the other hand, Ang-(1-7) promotes anti-inflammatory effects through its interactions with the Mas Receptor. These molecules might be possible therapeutic targets for treating COVID-19. Thus, the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 intracellular pathways and interactions with the RAS may clarify COVID-19 physiopathology and open perspectives for new treatments and strategies."

This review discusses past and currently evolving data on the etiological agent of the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, and its host cell receptors with a view to disclosing alternative drugs for palliative or therapeutic approaches. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits marked tropism for cells that harbor the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at their plasmalemma, predominantly in cells lining the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and bronchoalveolar cells, making these epithelial mucosae the most likely viral receptor cell targets and entry routes. Secondly, the crystal structures of several coronavirus spike proteins in complex with their cell host target receptors, and of SARS-Cov-2 in complex with an inhibitor, are now available at atomic resolution through X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Thirdly, viral entry of other viruses has been successfully blocked by inhibiting viral endogenous proteases or clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis, the same internalization pathway followed by ACE2 and some viruses. Fourthly, the target cell-surface receptor molecules and SARS-CoV-2 possess other putative sites for drugs potentially modulating receptor activity or virus processing. A multi-pronged pharmacological approach attacking more than one flank of the viral-receptor interactions is worth considering as a front-line strategy."

Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) may elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we compare the efficacy of the C5-targeting monoclonal antibody eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, marked lung function improvement, and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID-19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, attenuated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, faster serum LDH decline, and more prominent lymphocyte recovery. These early clinical results offer important insights into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19 and point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways in thromboinflammation.

COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-α and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause’s male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients.

SARS-CoV-2 enters human lung cells via the binding of its viral spike (S) protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4]. ACE2 plays a critical role in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) since it can catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to generate Ang 1–7, which exerts a protective effect on lung injury [5,6].

ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy; nevertheless, they may increase the expression of ACE2 and even increase the risk of infection [9]. Except for patients with hypertension, patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes and chronic kidney disease may also be administered RAAS blockers in disease management [[10], [11], [12], [13]].

In particular, tobacco smoking is one of the main contributors to respiratory diseases that include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer [6,7].

The unprecedented rate at which COVID-19 is spreading across the globe has perhaps surprised most of the epidemiologists in the world, which may be related to difficulties in the identification of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier. While some patients had a relatively mild course of the disease, showing little or no symptoms, it was reported that about 20% of COVID-19 patients required hospitalization, mainly due to severe respiratory manifestations [1–7]. The major morbidity and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are attributed to acute viral pneumonitis leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1,2,8–10]. Based on the previously reported experience with SARS outbreak in 2003, a substantial number of patients (15–49%) developed respiratory failure leading to ARDS, with a mortality rate of 13–64% [11–14]. While SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV, the overall estimated case fatality rate of COVID-19 to date was lower than the SARS (0.82–9.64% versus 11%), and thus it is difficult to predict the fatality rate of COVID-19 patients upon the development of ARDS based on extrapolation from SARS patients [15,16]. Besides, there have been advancements in the management of ARDS since the SARS outbreak which occurred 17 years ago which may lead to more favorable clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with ARDS.",Published online 2020 Aug 4.,"In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to the whole of China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The State Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (PRC) included novel coronavirus pneumonia as a category B infectious disease, but management measures for category A infectious diseases were adopted in China due to its strong infectivity, meaning that new discovered cases are required to be reported within 2 and 6 h in the city and countryside, respectively (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2). Major clinical presentations of COVID-19 are initially characterized by fever, fatigue, and cough, which are almost indistinguishable from influenza (3, 4). However, some patients present with non-respiratory symptoms at onset, such as in the nervous, digestive, and cardiovascular systems (5–7). Central nervous system (CNS) infections mostly refers to inflammation caused by pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, and parasites) invading into the CNS, which are mostly manifested as headache, vomiting, convulsions, dysphagia, paresis, anosmia, etc. (8, 9). Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can complicate with some neurological symptoms, such as headache, confusion, dizziness, impaired consciousness, altered mental status, ataxia, epilepsy, and skeletal muscle symptoms (10–14), combined with some respiratory symptoms, which could be misdiagnosed as CNS infections caused by other pathogens. These misdiagnoses not only delay the treatment but also increase the exposure risk of other patients and healthcare workers, or even nosocomial exposure risk (9, 15). Therefore, additional attention should be paid to the screening and identification of patients with CNS infection in clinical practice. In this paper, we discuss and summarize the difficulties and countermeasures faced in the fastlane treatment for diagnosis of CNS infections during the COVID-19 outbreak, hoping to provide reference and assistance to other physicians."

Thus, this review aims to understand the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the urban water cycle and its inactivation in different stages of treatment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for effective control to prevent any recurrence of the outbreak. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of individuals tested positive has been reported to be in the range of 104–108 copies/L depending on the infection stages. In the wastewater, dilution of feces results in the decrease of the viral load in the range of 102–106.5 copies/L. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in WWTP samples following the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can complement real epidemiological data from clinical testing to help to monitor disease outbreaks in a community. Though promising, high uncertainty involved with the WBE technique warrants further research for reliable and quantitative information. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in WWTPs depends on the operational parameters and is generally enhanced by the tertiary treatment and disinfection techniques with a higher dosage.

By January of 2020 it was clear the elderly are by far the most likely succumb to COVID-19 pneumonia, which is caused by a “cytokine storm.” (6, 7). Later, male sex, obesity, and possessing naturally melanin-rich skin while living outside of the tropics came to be known as the highest risk factors after older age (2p, 8–13, 14p, 15, 16). Unlike influenza, children under age 10 are almost completely spared in COVID-19 (17, 18). This unusual risk factor pattern presented a mystery that spawned studies showing that COVID-19 fatalities are especially high in areas with lower levels of sunshine due to latitude or air pollution, except when population vitamin D intake is high (9, 10, 12, 19–24). In fact, the risk groups for severe COVID-19 match the risk groups for vitamin D deficiency exactly, and there is biological plausibility: vitamin D is known to modulate the immune system, helping prevent both an under-reaction that allows upper respiratory infections to be contracted, and the over-reaction referred to in COVID-19 as the “cytokine storm” (see section Biological Plausibility Discussions) (19, 25, 26).

Lung is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing eventually acute respiratory distress syndrome associated to a thromboinflammatory state. The cytokinic storm, thromboinflammation and pulmonary tropism are the bedrock of tissue lesions responsible for acute respiratory failure and for prolonged infection that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. The thrombogenicity of this infectious disease is illustrated by the high frequency of thromboembolic events observed even in Covid-19 patients treated with anticoagulation. Increased D-Dimers, a biomarker reflecting activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are associated with higher mortality in Covid-19 patients.

As the Covid-19 pandemic began to take hold in March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified Santa Clara County, California, as a community requiring elevated containment strategies.1 Two at-risk populations were identified: elderly/immunocompromised persons and the health care workforce. At Stanford Medicine, we recognized that we were not prepared to meet the needs of our clinical and operational workforce within our current structures. An expanded and aligned approach to workforce protection across our system would be required. To coordinate system response efforts, we activated a hospital emergency incident control system (HEICS) and created a governance structure, chaired by physician executives, to oversee the clinical response and to coordinate operational priorities.",Published online 2020 Sep 9.,null

The first reports from China showed that children presented with milder symptoms as compared to adults infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020). Reasons for this have not been established, but several theories have been discussed, involving immune system differences such as thymic function, cross-reactive immunity to common cold coronaviruses, as well as differences in the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2, as well as a better overall health status among children as compared to the elderly (Brodin, 2020). The mild COVID-19 in children has been confirmed also in areas with high disease prevalence such as northern Italy (Parri et al., 2020). The view that COVID-19 disease course is always mild in children is now challenged by recent reports of children presenting with a rare, but very severe hyperinflammatory syndrome in the United Kingdom (Riphagen et al., 2020; Whittaker et al., 2020), Italy (Verdoni et al., 2020), Spain (Moraleda et al., 2020), and New York City (Cheung et al., 2020).

Here we present key position statements including observations about the pathophysiology of (ARF). In terms of the pathophysiology of pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 can be divided into 3 phases. Pulmonary damage in advanced COVID-19 often differs from the known changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two types (type L and type H) are differentiated, corresponding to early- and late-stage lung damage. This differentiation should be taken into consideration in the respiratory support of ARF. The assessment of the extent of ARF should be based on arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions, and it needs to include the calculation of oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin level, the corrected values of Hüfner's factor, and cardiac output). Aerosols can cause transmission of infectious, virus-laden particles. Open systems or vented systems can increase the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened and endotracheal intubation carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should have top priority because fear of contagion should not be a primary reason for intubation. Based on the current knowledge, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow therapy (NHF), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be performed without an increased risk of infection to staff if PPE is provided. A significant proportion of patients with ARF present with relevant hypoxemia, which often cannot be fully corrected, even with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO<sub>2</sub>) under NHF. In this situation, the oxygen therapy can be escalated to CPAP or NIV when the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not met. In ARF, NIV should be carried out in an intensive care unit or a comparable setting by experienced staff. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring and readiness for intubation are to be ensured at all times. If the ARF progresses under CPAP/NIV, intubation should be implemented without delay in patients who do not have a “do not intubate” order."

SARS-CoV-2 virus preferentially impacts the cells in the respiratory system, but the direct effects of its damage on other organs including heart, liver, brain, and kidneys have also been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Prasanna and Abilash, 2020). An unanswered question has been currently raised why SARS-CoV-2 can result in a wide variety of clinical manifestations ranging from: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to severe states in COVID-19 patients, a major challenge in the management of medical decisions and interventions (Gandhi et al., 2020; Meini et al., 2020; Michelen et al., 2020).

Obviously, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is largely related to its interplay with the host. Indeed, the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral immunity, including innate and acquired immune response, should be investigated (Ahmadpoor and Rostaing, 2020; Ranucci et al., 2020).

Five patients developed large vessel stroke, largely attributed to the predilection for thromboembolism in critically ill SARS patients [1]. A study covering all adult and paediatric patients admitted to public hospitals during the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Singapore [2], identified 98 neurological complications developing at median of two days after onset. Majority were in patients less than 19 years old and the commonest disorder was seizures. Influenza associated encephalopathy occurred in 20%. A wider range of neurological conditions were seen among adults, half presenting with an exacerbation of their pre-existent neurological disease.",Published online 2020 Dec 14.,"Convalescent plasma (CP) has emerged as a treatment for COVID-19. However, the composition and mechanism of action are not fully known. Therefore, we undertook a two-phase controlled study in which, first the immunological and metabolomic status of recovered and severe patients were evaluated. Secondly, the 28-day effect of CP on the immune response in severe patients was assessed. Nineteen recovered COVID-19 patients, 18 hospitalized patients with severe disease, and 16 pre-pandemic controls were included. Patients with severe disease were treated with CP transfusion and standard therapy (i.e., plasma recipients, n = 9) or standard therapy alone (n = 9). Clinical and biological assessments were done on day 0 and during follow-up on days 4, 7, 14, and 28. Clinical parameters, viral load, total immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), autoantibodies, cytokines, T and B cells, and metabolomic and lipidomic profiles were examined. Total IgG and IgA anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were key factors for CP selection and correlated with NAbs. In severe COVID-19 patients, mostly interleukin (IL)-6 (P = <0.0001), IL-10 (P = <0.0001), IP-10 (P = <0.0001), fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids were higher than in recovered patients. Latent autoimmunity and anti–IFN–α antibodies were observed in both recovered and severe patients. COVID-19 CP induced an early but transient cytokine profile modification and increases IgG anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. At day 28 post-transfusion, a decrease in activated, effector and effector memory CD4+ (P < 0.05) and activated and effector CD8+ (P < 0.01) T cells and naïve B cells (P = 0.001), and an increase in non-classical memory B cells (P=<0.0001) and central memory CD4+ T cells (P = 0.0252) were observed. Moreover, IL-6/IFN-γ (P = 0.0089) and IL-6/IL-10 (P = 0.0180) ratios decreased in plasma recipients compared to those who received standard therapy alone. These results may have therapeutic implications and justify further post-COVID-19 studies."

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, and it is believed to play a crucial role in the mechanism of acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV [14]. The ability of spike-Fc protein treatment (3h) to downregulate ACE2 protein expression has been shown in an in vitro system (cell lines) and also in vivo in lung cells of mice [14,15], suggesting that ACE2 pathway may be down-modulated during infection. However, ACE2 is constitutively expressed and released from the apical cell surface of human airway epithelia into airway surface liquid [16]. Of note, its surface down-modulation upon spike protein challenge has been shown to be due to ACE2 shedding mediated by activation of extracellular ADAM17/TACE metalloprotease, which concomitantly induces shedding/production of TNFα [17,18]. Interestingly, ACE2 shedding is enhanced not only by binding with spike protein [17,18], but also by IL-1β and TNFα inflammatory cytokines [16], cytokines that are secreted at relatively high concentration in COVID-19 patients [2]. Moreover, soluble (s)ACE2 (induced or not by virus binding) released from human airway epithelia has been demonstrated to retain both its enzymatic activity and its binding ability for spike viral protein, finally reducing spike protein-mediated viral entry into target cells [16,17]. Therefore, the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein of SARS-CoV induces a cellular “protective” ACE2 shedding feedback response that initially limits viral entry. Nevertheless, ADAM17/TACE-mediated ACE2 shedding or ACE2 enzymatic activity have been shown to intriguingly correlate positively with viral infection and disease complications [17,19,20]. In contrast, HNL63-CoV, which similarly binds to ACE2 through its spike protein, infects ACE2-bearing cells and mainly induces the common cold, leading to neither ACE2 shedding nor SARS [17]. Moreover, catalytically inactive forms of sACE2 can potently inhibit SARS-CoV infection [19,21], suggesting that events downstream of ACE2 shedding and/or its enzymatic activity may indirectly and subsequently favour viral infection and/or disease complications. To this regard, sACE2 was also associated with myocardial pathological conditions [22] and cardiovascular complications including hypotension (known to enhance both renin and angiotensin I, the substrate of ACE/ACE2) and tachycardia were common in SARS-CoV patients [23]. Since spike protein has been shown to not inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity that is retained by sACE2-spike protein complex [16,17,24] and, in general, sACE2 maintains its enzymatic activity, we cannot consider its higher circulating expression a mere disease biomarker. Indeed, ACE2 shedding might repress its local function but it certainly enhances its circulating/systemic activity. Interestingly, a recent integrative bioinformatics analysis shows that the gene expression of ACE2 in human bronchial cells infected with SARS-CoV is dramatically increased 24h after infection and remained at a high level for at least 2 days, suggesting that ACE2 may be involved in a positive feedback loop post-infection [25]. In the same report, it has been shown that ACE2 expression level in bronchial epithelium obtained by brushing from asthmatic and normal subjects was similar, suggesting that respiratory epithelial cells of healthy subjects and asthmatic patients have similar ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2. Of note, ACE2 was also identified as the receptor for the novel spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [13]. Although the role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and in inducing lung injury is still unknown, ACE2 behaves similarly to original SARS-CoV [13] (Box 1).",Published online 2020 Oct 15.,There are limited data on the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Direct household contacts of COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 owing to its in vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains inconclusive. In this open-label, controlled clinical trial, asymptomatic individuals who had direct contact with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in the last 2 weeks were offered HCQ prophylaxis and assigned to PEP (n = 132) or control (n = 185) group. The PEP group received HCQ 800 mg on Day 1 followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both groups undertook home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene. Over 4-week follow-up, 50/317 participants (15.8%) had new-onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (P = 0.033) lower in the PEP (14/132; 10.6%) compared to the control (36/185; 19.5%) group (total absolute risk reduction, –8.9% points). The NNT to prevent the occurrence of 1 COVID-19 case was 12. Overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI 0.33–1.05). Compliance was good. The most common adverse event was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation (three participants), with no serious adverse events. PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Until definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals. Further randomised clinical trials with larger samples are required for better evaluation of HCQ as PEP for COVID-19 prevention."

Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation, and passive viral neutralization not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation, both of which are limited resources."

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) permanently named the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared the crisis a pandemic (Enserink 2020). As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), latest situation report (Sep 14, 2020) at the time of this writing, more than 28.9 million confirmed cases with more than millions of deaths have been reported in 208 countries (Organisation 2020). The first reported case of COVID-19 was in Wuhan, Hubei province with symptoms such as fever, cold, shortness in breath very similar to the common cold in few cases and within a week had a reported cluster cases of acute pneumonia (Nishiura et al. 2020). The Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the patients revealed slight opacity and difference from the healthy scan of the lungs (Ai et al. 2020). It was concluded as a possible case of pneumonia but the speculation was rejected as soon as PCR results revealed it belongs to coronavirus family using the bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the patients (Ai et al. 2020). It was speculated that the viral disease caused had a zoonotic source.

Several of the cytokines involved in COVID-19 employ a distinct intracellular signaling pathway mediated by Janus kinases (JAKs). JAK inhibition, therefore, presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for CRS, which is a common cause of adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

The objective of this review was to collate information regarding the potential of plants and natural products to inhibit coronavirus and targets associated with infection in humans and to highlight known drugs, which may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the similarity in the RNA genome, main proteases, and primary host receptor between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, a review was conducted on plants and secondary metabolites, which have shown activity against SARS-CoV. Numerous scientific reports on the potential of plants and secondary metabolites against SARS-CoV infection were found, providing important information on their possible activity against SARS-CoV-2. Based on current literature, 83 compounds have been identified with the potential to inhibit COVID-19. The most prominent selectivity was found for the alkaloid, lycorine, the lignan, savinin, and the abietane terpenoid, 8-beta-hydroxyabieta-9(11),13-dien-12-one with selectivity index values greater than 945, 667, and 510, respectively.

Meanwhile, many others were laid off or worked reduced hours, and some front line workers were required to work longer hours. Concurrently, a surge in reports of “pandemic baking” suggested a cascade effect on eating behaviors, which may be an inadvertent strategy to cope with stress. We conducted an online survey of people living in Canada or the United States (N = 680) to assess how employment change may have been experienced as stressful and linked to a shift in food choices. Regression models suggested that reduced hours and being laid off were associated with greater stress appraisals, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping responses, and negative affect. In turn, negative affect was associated with eating to cope and unhealthy snack choices, like salty or sweet treats. Our study emphasizes that under stressful conditions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, some coping strategies may contribute to the greater vulnerability to downstream effects, particularly those relating to eating choices and nutritional balances."

The exact reasons for such variations are not clear yet. This review discussed the possible effects of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and mortality based on some recent evidence. The findings of most studies reviewed here demonstrate that both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution especially PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) may contribute significantly to higher rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities with a lesser extent also PM10. A significant correlation has been found between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality in some countries in the world. The available data also indicate that exposure to air pollution may influence COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, exposure to air pollution may increase vulnerability and have harmful effects on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 infections.

In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades’ worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive.

The coronavirus family has been around for many years and is a zoonotic virus found in bats, camels, and cats. Viruses from this family do not prefer human beings as hosts possibly due to the high core body temperature (37 °C) [8]. The survival temperature of coronaviruses may be below 35 °C. However, as a result of mutations in the coronavirus, some members of this family can survive in humans. Evidence of such genetic alterations was seen in the first corona outbreak of 2003.

The clinical features of patients affected by COVID-19 have been extensively explored, but the predisposing factors contributing to increased transmission and clinical severity remain unclear. Social and ecological health determinants such as air pollution [2,3,4,5] have been suggested to increase the risk of infection and exacerbate COVID-19-related illness. In addition, several comorbidities have been proposed to increase COVID-19 mortality rates, including cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies [6,7]. The predominance of these comorbidities in advanced age, combined with the increased incidence of mortality in elderly patients, suggests that age is a major risk factor for COVID-19 mortality [8]. Given the increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases with ageing, these observations have raised concerns about the vulnerability of patients living with chronic neurological conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterised by the progressive loss of neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems.

In contrast to AD, only a subset of PD patients develop dementia [11]. However, in both diseases, patients experience a gradual worsening of their clinical condition as neuronal loss progresses, ultimately affecting their quality of life.

SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. In this review, we discuss the immunopathology of COVID-19, its potential mechanisms, and clinical implications to aid the development of new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19."

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can contribute to inflammation-associated lung damage, thrombosis, and fibrosis. However, whether NETs infiltrate particular compartments in severe COVID-19 lungs remains to be clarified.

Such environmental surveillance has been in use for poliovirus, the causative agent of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in the United Nation's Polio Eradication Program since 1988 [1]. Although health surveillance focuses on monitoring AFP and screening stool samples for poliovirus, the rationale for sewage surveillance of poliovirus is derived from the characteristics of poliovirus infections. More than 95% of individuals infected with poliovirus develop no or mild gastrointestinal symptoms, but do excrete large numbers of poliovirus in faeces for periods of up to several weeks, and the virus particles remain detectable and infectious in (waste)water for days to weeks, depending on the environmental conditions [2]. Therefore, surveillance of wastewater for poliovirus can be used to determine the extent of a poliovirus outbreak and can even be used as early warning of poliovirus circulation in a community before cases of AFP are noted [3]. Sewage surveillance of poliovirus has played a key role in documenting the eradication of polio from India and Egypt, and served to detect outbreaks of poliovirus infections in polio-free countries, such as The Netherlands, Finland, Israel, Brazil, China and others [4]. In the current ‘endgame’ of the Global Polio Eradication Program, sewage surveillance is used to detect any residual poliovirus circulation in endemic countries and provide early warning of import of poliovirus. Sewage surveillance has been studied for other enteric viruses [5,6] and for antimicrobial resistance [7].",Published online 2020 Aug 24.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has already caused in excess of 1.25 million deaths worldwide, and the number is increasing.

Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses.

Recently, emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with neurological alterations in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical manifestations. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process, as well as the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, are still poorly understood. Glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, play pivotal roles in the brain response to neuroinflammatory insults and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, accumulating evidence has shown that those cells are targets of several neurotropic viruses that severely impact their function. Glial cell dysfunctions have been associated with several neuroinflammatory diseases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 likely has a primary effect on these cells in addition to a secondary effect from neuronal damage.

It has made a great impact on the human population after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (Shereen et al., 2020). COVID-19 is a type of virus that causes pneumonia by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). People prone to this viral infection get primarily infected in the lungs, resulting in inflammatory conditions causing severe damage to alveolar cells leading to high fluid accumulation. This causes gas exchange obstruction, which proceeds to symptoms like respiratory difficulties, dry cough, fever, chest pain, muscle aches, fatigue, chills, and later pneumonia-like symptoms, which leads to a severe condition termed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Yuki et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). If the inflammation becomes severe, viral particles enter through the blood resulting in septic shock and multi-organ failure and the condition is called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Fig. 1 ).",Published online 2020 Aug 4.,"There is a vast practice of using antimalarial drugs, RAS inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the virus and immunosuppressants for the treatment of the severe form of COVID-19, which often occurs in patients with chronic diseases and older persons. Currently, the clinical efficacy of these drugs for COVID-19 has not been proven yet. Side effects of antimalarial drugs can worsen the condition of patients and increase the likelihood of death. Peptides, given their physiological mechanism of action, have virtually no side effects. Many of them are geroprotectors and can be used in patients with chronic diseases. Peptides may be able to prevent the development of the pathological process during COVID-19 by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins, thereby having immuno- and bronchoprotective effects on lung cells, and normalizing the state of the hemostasis system. Immunomodulators (RKDVY, EW, KE, AEDG), possessing a physiological mechanism of action at low concentrations, appear to be the most promising group among the peptides. They normalize the cytokines’ synthesis and have an anti-inflammatory effect, thereby preventing the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure."

As of October 3, 2020, more than 1 million deaths and 34 million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported worldwide (1). T cells play a fundamental role in viral infections (2). It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes overall reduction in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in peripheral blood (3, 4). The extent of this lymphopenia was correlated with COVID-19-associated disease severity and mortality (2, 5–8). Currently, little is known regarding the phenotype and function of T cell subsets in COVID-19. Generally, CD8+ T cells seem to be activated more than the CD4+ T cells (9, 10). The levels of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) tend to increase in severe cases compared to those in the non-severe cases (3). Impaired cellular functionality in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has been observed in severe COVID-19 cases along with generally lower interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production (11, 12). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a robust B cell response. Virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA have been detected in the days following infection (13). Additionally, high virus-specific antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 have been observed to be inversely correlated with viral load in patients (14, 15). During the recovery stage of COVID-19 patients, T and B cells are highly expressed (16). In a recent study, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and in convalescent asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces robust, broad, and highly functional memory T cell responses (17).",Published online 2020 Dec 19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly infectious and its ongoing outbreak has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO.

Given SARS-CoV-2 is a sister to SARS-CoV, of the SARS-related coronavirus species, we made a comprehensive comparison between them to learn from experiences with SARS. Although there is no evidence supporting the intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, our comprehensive analysis suggests that the adverse maternal and infant outcomes caused by COVID-19 cannot be underestimated. Further, we speculated that the inconsistency between nucleic acids and serological characteristics IgM to SARS-CoV-2 of infants' specimens may be caused by the disruption of the amniotic barrier by the inflammatory factors induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Up to now, effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 is not available. Therefore, throughout virus infections, a thorough clarification of the virus-host immune system interactions will be most probably helpful to encounter these challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 primarily suppresses the innate immune system, enabling its stable propagation during the early stage of infection. Consequently, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been increasing during infection progression associated with severe lung pathology. It is imperative to consider hyper inflammation in vaccine designing, as vaccine-induced immune responses must have a protective role against infection without leading to immunopathology. Among the front-line responders to viral infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells have immense therapeutic potential, forming a bridge between innate and adaptive responses. A subset of NK cells exhibits putatively increased effector functions against viruses following pathogen-specific and immunization. Memory NK cells have higher cytotoxicity and effector activity, compared with the conventional NK cells. As a pioneering strategy, prompt accumulation and long‐term maintenance of these memory NK cells could be an efficacious viral treatment. According to the high prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the world, it remains to be determined whether HCMV adaptive NK cells could play a protective role against this new emerging virus. In addition, the new adaptive-like KIR+NKG2C+ NK cell subset (the adaptive-like lung tissue residue [tr]NK cell) in the context of the respiratory infection at this site could specifically exhibit the expansion upon COVID-19. Another aspect of NK cells we should note, utilizing modified NK cells such as allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells as a state-of-the-art strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. In this line, we speculate introducing NKG2C into chimeric antigen receptors in NK cells might be a potential approach in future viral immunotherapy for emerging viruses. In this contribution, we will briefly discuss the current status and future perspective of NK cells, which provide to successfully exploit NK cell-mediated antiviral activity that may offer important new tools in COVID-19 treatment."

Another consideration is that epidemic preparedness may be much higher, with prior experience with Ebola, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), etc. The strong burden of endemic infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, and ongoing outbreaks of Lassa fever and Ebola in Nigeria and Congo, suggest an unpredictable and unusual response to COVID-19 (5, 7).

However, the results of preliminary large-scale randomized controlled trials have failed to show any survival benefit of such drug therapy in COVID-19. Despite the lack of such evidence, hydroxychloroquine has been used as a desperate attempt for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. The drug has wide-ranging drug interactions and potential cardiotoxicity. Indiscriminate unsupervised use can expose the public to serious adverse drug effects."

Unfortunately, the outbreak is rapidly spreading worldwide. In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines to prevent or treat this infection, its rapid dissemination may affect public healthcare systems and severe economic and social distress worldwide [11,12].

The reason older patients and males show increased risk of severe disease and death remains uncertain. Sex hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, might be implicated in the age-dependent and sex-specific severity of COVID-19. High testosterone levels could upregulate transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), facilitating the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women. In this perspective, we discuss the available evidence on sex hormones and hormone therapy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and we highlight the possible implications for cancer patients, who can receive hormonal therapies during their treatment plans."

The data analysis has been limited to the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the lockdown-dependent biased effects on the atmospheric pollutant levels as much as possible. The analysis looked at non-linear, monotonic correlations using the Spearman non-parametric correlation index. The statistical significance of the Spearman correlations has also been evaluated. The results of the statistical analysis suggest the hypothesis of a moderate-to-strong correlation between the number of days exceeding the annual regulatory limits of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 incidence, mortality and lethality rates for all the 107 territorial areas in Italy. A weak-to-moderate correlation seems to exist when considering the 36 territorial areas in four of the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 showed a higher non-linear correlation than NO2 with incidence, mortality and lethality rates. As to particulate matters, PM10 profile has been compared with the incidence rate variation that occurred in three of the most affected territorial areas in Northern Italy (i.e., Milan, Brescia, and Bergamo).

We analysed the primary health records of 13,338 UK individuals tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020.

The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. ACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalysing the hydrolysis of angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin (1–7) (a vasodilator). ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1–7).

It has been calamitous to the personal health and finances of millions and also–largely due to the infection’s high mortality rate–to global healthcare systems and societal economic welfare. Approximately 15–20% of Covid-19-infected patients suffer a severe form of the acute infection (Bulut and Kato, 2020, Rabec et al., 2020, Grasselli et al., 2020) hallmarked by hyperinflammatory cytokine storms causing far more morbidity and mortality than from any direct viral cytotoxicity. This has a high mortality risk (Zhou et al., 2020a)– ≥50% in some subpopulations (e.g. patients with cardiac injury or requiring continuous renal replacement therapy)–(Fominskiy et al., 2020, Shi et al., 2020, Bhatraju et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020) and requires hospitalisation and, often, mechanical ventilation. The Covid-19 cytokine storm is characterised by rapid proliferation and hyperactivation of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells, and the overproduction of >150 inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators released by immune or nonimmune cells (Sun et al., 2020, Mangalmurti and Hunter, 2020). Among these inflammatory cells, mast cells (MCs) may play an important role because when they recognise viral products, they are activated and synthesise many chemokines and cytokines. In addition, some cytokines secreted by other cells such as T cells, damaged epithelial and endothelial cells (Mukai et al., 2018), or even by themselves (Hermans et al., 2019), stimulate MC activation. MCs regulate the functions of immune cells such as dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, T cells, B cells and NK cells. They also recruit immune cells to inflamed tissue by secreting chemokines and other mediators which locally increase vascular permeability (Abraham and St John, 2010, Krystel-Whittemore et al., 2016, St John et al., 2011).",Published online 2020 May 13.,null

Previous epidemiological data suggest that approximately 20% of hospitalized patients have evidence of cardiac injury as indicated by elevated levels of high-sensitivity troponins (hs-cTnI) (1). In 1 study in which troponin I was measured within 24 h of admission to assess cardiac damage, 36% of patients had elevated troponin I concentrations. After adjusting for disease severity and relevant risk factor differences, even small amounts of myocardial injury were associated with increased mortality (2). However, much remains unknown about the nature of myocardial injury in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease but evidence of myocardial injury (defined as positive troponin with or without wall motion abnormalities), physicians often default to the diagnosis of myocarditis as the underlying cause using data such as clinical and imaging markers of myocyte injury. Indeed, most published cases of presumed myocarditis induced by COVID-19 infection were based on blood troponin levels or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) without tissue diagnosis (3, 4, 5). However, direct evidence for myocarditis in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains very limited (6,7).

However, in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) or SARS-CoV-2 infection, poor prognosis is reportedly associated with ACE2 downregulation [15]. Theoretically, fewer viral entry routes should correspond to improved clinical outcomes. However, studies have demonstrated that decreased ACE2 expression levels lead to greater illness severity and more serious end-organ damage because ACE2 plays an anti-inflammatory role under renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation [16]. Classical RAAS involves the conversion of Angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II and AngII binding with angiotensin-1 receptor (AT1R). The classic RAAS pathway involves vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. The non-classical RAAS pathway, on the other hand, converts AngII to Ang(1–7) by ACE2, and the binding of Ang(1–7) with Mas receptor (MasR) provides vasodilatation and an anti-inflammatory effect [17]. Viral invasion into host cells occurs primarily through the ACE2 receptor; this receptor may mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells through two distinct routes. The first involves clathrin-dependent endocytosis and the second involves ACE2 receptor–mediated TMPRSS2-dependent membrane fusion [18].",Published online 2020 Nov 23.,"There is an urgent need to identify antivirals against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to contain future similar emergencies early on.

Interestingly, physiological serum levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects were significantly decreased compared to the matched control group, reaching a marked 50% reduction in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, no correlation at all was observed between 24-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol serum levels and the severity of the disease. Opposite to that of 27-hydroxycholesterol was the behaviour of two recognized markers of redox imbalance, i.e. 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, whose serum levels were significantly increased especially in severe COVID-19.

The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the genus β-Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales. A similar human coronavirus was found to be responsible for SARS in 2002 and 2003. The virus responsible for COVID-19 has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 30 kb, which has 74% to 99% identity with that of the coronavirus from the pangolin (Manis javanica) and horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) (Bat-CoVRaTG13), respectively [2,20,21,22,23]. Bats have been reported as being the rich source of coronaviruses [24,25], although only a few of these coronaviruses can infect humans [26,27]. According to the literature, the SARS and MERS viruses have zoonotic transmission, originating from bats using palm civets and camels, respectively, as the intermediate hosts [28,29,30,31,32]. The recent reports have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is a modified coronavirus of bat origin [22,32], which came to humans as a result of zoonotic transmission [33,34]. A coronavirus identified from the Malayan pangolin has been shown to have a 99% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of pangolin-CoV has only a one amino acid difference with that of SARS-CoV-2; the infected pangolins exhibit pathological symptoms similar to humans suffering from COVID-19, and their blood circulating antibodies can react with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [35,36]. Although the RaTG13 coronavirus isolated from bat has about 96% identity with SARS-CoV-2, its RBD is different from that of the later, exhibiting a low binding ability to the human ACE2 [37]. However, the RBD of the S-protein from pangolin-CoV is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, six residues critical for receptor binding being identical in both [38]. A comparative analysis of genetic data available to date has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 originated by the recombination of pangolin-CoV and the bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus [35,39,40,41]. Based on this information, the pangolin is considered to be one of the possible intermediate hosts between bat and human. Snakes, minks, and turtles are also being investigated as the potential intermediate hosts [42,43] (Figure 1). Five out of the six critical amino acid residues comprising the RBD of the S-protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are different, contradicting the theories about the laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2 by the manipulation of SARS or MERS like viruses [43]. Studies based on the analysis of N, S, and ORF1a/1b genes have shown conserved sequences suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is an animal virus, which was transmitted to humans by undergoing evolutionary adaptations [22,44]. The SARS infection from 2003, also involved zoonotic transmission of the virus to humans. Hence, further studies are required to confirm the intermediate hosts of coronaviruses to control zoonotic transmission and avoid the outbreak of such viral infections in the future [28].",Published online 2020 Oct 1.,null

Most studies suggest that a negative correlation exists between ambient temperature and humidity on the one hand and the number of COVID-19 cases on the other, while there have been studies which support the absence of any correlation or even a positive one. The urban environment and specifically the air ventilation rate, as well as air pollution, can probably affect, also, the transmission dynamics and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. Due to the inherent limitations in previously published studies, it remains unclear if the magnitude of the effect of temperature or humidity on COVID-19 is confounded by the public health measures implemented widely during the first pandemic wave.

However, compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has higher transmissibility and lower mortality (although still higher than influenza) [1]. The mortality rate of COVID-19 was reported to be ~3.4% among all patients and 1.4% among patients without underlying disease, but 13.2% among patients with pre-existing CVD [2]. Among inpatients with COVID-19, the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities has ranged between 17.1% and 59.6%, and mortality in those with pre-existing hypertension or CVD is 1.42-fold and 3.15-fold higher than those without, respectively (Table 1 ) [2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7.].",Published online 2020 Aug 15.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent for a series of atypical respiratory diseases in the Hubei Province of Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The disease SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by an extracellular membrane containing a series of spike glycoproteins resembling a crown. COVID-19 infection results in diverse symptoms and morbidity depending on individual genetics, ethnicity, age, and geographic location. In severe cases, COVID-19 pathophysiology includes destruction of lung epithelial cells, thrombosis, hypercoagulation, and vascular leak leading to sepsis. These events lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis in patients. COVID-19 risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, which are highly prevalent in the United States. This population has upregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is exploited by COVID-19 as the route of entry and infection. Viral envelope proteins bind to and degrade ACE2 receptors, thus preventing normal ACE2 function. COVID-19 infection causes imbalances in ACE2 and induces an inflammatory immune response, known as a cytokine storm, both of which amplify comorbidities within the host. Herein, we discuss the genetics, pathogenesis, and possible therapeutics of COVID-19 infection along with secondary complications associated with disease progression, including ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms of COVID-19 infection will allow the development of vaccines or other novel therapeutic approaches to prevent transmission or reduce the severity of infection."

We studied the connection between NETs and COVID-19 severity and progression. We conducted a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients (n = 33) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 17). We measured plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes (NETs), platelet factor 4, RANTES, and selected cytokines. Three COVID-19 lung autopsies were examined for NETs and platelet involvement. We assessed NET formation ex vivo in COVID-19 neutrophils and in healthy neutrophils incubated with COVID-19 plasma.

CoVs cause diseases in a wide variety of birds and mammals and have been found in humans since 1960. To date, seven human CoVs were identified including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the novel virus that first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to 213 countries as of the writing this paper.

SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious and is capable of spreading from human to human. Infection routes include droplet and contact, and aerosol transmission is currently under investigation. It is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 became an emergency of international concern. As of July 12, 2020, the virus has been responsible for 12,698,995 confirmed cases and 564,924 deaths worldwide and the number is still increasing. Up until now, no specific treatment has yet been proven effective against SARS-CoV-2.

The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation."

Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that skin manifestations associated with COVID-19 are extremely polymorphic [3]. In this regard, our group proposed the following six main clinical patterns of COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations in a recently published review article: (i) urticarial rash, (ii) confluent erythematous/maculopapular/morbilliform rash, (iii) papulovesicular exanthem, (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern, (v) livedo reticularis/racemosa-like pattern, (vi) purpuric “vasculitic” pattern (shown in Fig.

Here, we combined scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and scATAC-seq to compare immune cell types in peripheral blood collected from young and old subjects and patients with COVID-19. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed with age and was characterized by T cell polarization from naive and memory cells to effector, cytotoxic, exhausted and regulatory cells, along with increased late natural killer cells, age-associated B cells, inflammatory monocytes and age-associated dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of genes, which were implicated in coronavirus susceptibility, was upregulated in a cell subtype-specific manner with age. Notably, COVID-19 promoted age-induced immune cell polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and cellular senescence.

Histopathological analyses reveal widespread alveolar damage and pneumonia, which may eventually progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Bradley et al., 2020). This clinically challenging manifestation is accompanied by the production of multiple cytokines (“cytokine storm”), loss of parenchyma, immune infiltration, and fluid filled alveoli, all of which contribute to acute respiratory failure and eventual death (Huang et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2020). The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus uses the same receptor—ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type-2)—for entry into target cells as the closely related viruses SARS-CoV (2003) and NL-63 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). However, the unique clinical symptoms and increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that it uses different mechanisms to both infect and evade host immune responses, including the production of type I and type III interferons (IFN-IIIs) (Hou et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). To develop safe and effective therapies for COVID-19, it is critically important to understand the cell-type-specific innate immune mechanisms triggered in response to viral entry and how they orchestrate adaptive immune responses. One way to achieve this goal is to infect target cells of the adult human lung with virus ex vivo and to follow molecular and cellular responses over time.

The impacts of temperature and humidity on the COVID-19 transmission rate are still under discussion. Here, we elucidated these relationships by utilizing two unique scenarios, repeated measurement and natural experiment, using the COVID-19 cases reported from January 23 – February 21, 2020, in China. The modeling results revealed that higher temperature was most strongly associated with decreased COVID-19 transmission at a lag time of 8 days. Relative humidity (RH) appeared to have only a slight effect. These findings were verified by assessing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity under the relevant conditions of temperature (4°C–37°C) and RH (> 40%). We concluded that temperature increase made an important, but not determined, contribution to restrain the COVID-19 outbreak in China. It suggests that the emphasis of other effective controlling polices should be strictly implemented to restrain COVID-19 transmission in cold seasons."

Elucidating the changes in hematological parameters in SARS–CoV–2 infected patients could help to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and may provide early clues to diagnosis. Several studies have shown that hematological parameters are markers of disease severity and suggest that they mediate disease progression."

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions."

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China toward the end of 2019, 32,110,656 cases were reported worldwide, and the virus caused 980,031 deaths, accounting for 3.05% of the infected population as of September 25, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). To date, no effective vaccines and promising antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, and the currently available drugs are still under investigation. Therefore, many critically ill patients are treated with off-label antiviral drugs. Many drugs in emergency use are based on in vitro evidence or expert opinions. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status or mild respiratory disease to severe pneumonia (Lai et al., 2020).

Later on, from the sequenced-based characterization of lower respiratory tract samples isolated from the infected patients, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that this viral disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and named the disease as COVID-19 [1]. The COVID-19, which has now emerged as a global pandemic, was reported to be first instigated from the seafood market where live animals like frogs, bats, snakes, snails, birds, pigs, cats and dogs are regularly wholesaled in Wuhan city of PRC [2]. After analysis of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 causing virus, it was decided that infected person might have visited the seafood market situated in the Wuhan City or might have consumed infected birds or animals. Conversely, further surveys exposed that few cases were also reported where individuals got infected even though they have not visited the seafood market of the Wuhan city. Owing to this investigation, it was confirmed that COVID-19 causing virus was competent for community transmission through human as a carrier and thus, rapidly spread over more than 200 countries in the globe [3]. This novel virus is transmitted from human to human due to the close contact with the infected person or due to the exposure to the respiratory droplets released during coughing and sneezing of an infected person. This type of respiratory droplets of the infected person can enter into the respiratory system of a healthy human through the mouth and nose during breathing [4].",null,"The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has taken a significant toll on people and countries all over the world. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated yet. This includes the interplay between inflammation and coagulation which needs further investigation. The massive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines results in the so-called cytokine storm, leading to plasma leakage, vascular hyperpermeability, and disseminated vascular coagulation. This is usually accompanied by multiorgan failure. The extensive changes in the serum levels of cytokines are thought to play a crucial role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Additionally, the viral load and host inflammation factors are believed to have a significant role in host damage, particularly lung damage, from SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, patients exhibit quantitative and qualitative differences in their immune responses to the virus, which can impact the clinical manifestation and outcomes of COVID-19. There needs to be a better understanding of the dynamic events that involve immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and viral replication in the context of the COVID-19 infection.

Both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were much higher in patients on mechanical ventilation as compared with patients breathing room air. Another interesting finding of this study [17] is that sera from COVID-19 patents triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro, indicating that circulating NETs could be used to predict the extent of disease severity.

Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients—especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron—are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19."

Diagnostic tests demonstrate the presence or absence of an infectious agent. Early and better diagnosis has helped in limiting fatalities due to highly infectious and contagious diseases in the past (Caliendo et al., 2013). Diagnosis has an empirical role in such diseases that are caused by any novel pathogen for which the population is not pre-immune. COVID-19 is one of such infectious diseases, highly contagious and deadly (Cascella et al., 2020). COVID-19 was found to be caused by a novel viral pathogen named as SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 originated in Wuhan city of China and spread to almost the entire world (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). In January 2020, China reported the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that was further declared as pandemic owing to indiscriminate and rapid spread to different parts of world. Among the first 41 cases of COVID-19 reported by Huang et al., most of the patients had a history of exposure to Wuhan wild animal market. Patients had several symptoms like cough, fever, dyspnea, fatigue and radiographic indication of pneumonia (Huang et al., 2020). Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 led scientists to design testing protocols to detect the pathogen in the affected people and also provided an insight in the phylogenetic study of the virus. It was elucidated that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of beta-coronavirus, which include SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses (Zhou et al., 2020a). The origin of this virus is still a matter of debate; however, bats are thought to be its primary source. SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 3rd January 2020 in the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid samples taken from a patient in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020). As the understanding regarding COVID-19 disease evolved, it was observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection spreads via asymptomatic carriers (Rothe et al., 2020), which further prompted health workers to increase the diagnostic frequency among the masses.",null,"COVID-19 has spread to all countries around the world after it was first discovered in Wuhan of China at the end of 2019. It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection. Since most infected kids were boys in China, there may be sex-dependent immune response in pediatric COVID-19 cases as well."

This immune homeostasis is usually disturbed during chronic viral infection. Using publicly available transcriptomic datasets, we conducted in silico analyses to evaluate the expression pattern of 38 selected immune inhibitory receptors (IRs) associated with different myeloid and lymphoid immune cells during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Our analyses revealed a pattern of overall upregulation of IR mRNA during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A large number of IRs expressed on both lymphoid and myeloid cells were upregulated in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), while lymphoid-associated IRs were specifically upregulated in autopsies, reflecting severe, terminal stage COVID-19 disease. Eight genes (BTLA, LAG3, FCGR2B, PDCD1, CEACAM1, CTLA4, CD72, and SIGLEC7), shared by NPSs and autopsies, were more expressed in autopsies and were directly correlated with viral levels. Single-cell data from blood and bronchoalveolar samples also reflected the observed association between IR upregulation and disease severity. Moreover, compared to SARS-CoV-1, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus infections, the number and intensities of upregulated IRs were higher in SARS-CoV-2 infections. In conclusion, the immunopathology and severity of COVID-19 could be attributed to dysregulation of different immune inhibitors. Targeting one or more of these immune inhibitors could represent an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of COVID-19 early and late immune dysregulations."

The experience of European Pulmonary Pathologists,"COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Autopsy, Lung, Pandemic","The viral family Coronaviridae are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, and typically cause mild respiratory diseases in humans [1]. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus species 2 or SARS-CoV-2, which suddenly poses a major health burden to humans. Together with SARS-CoV, the agent of SARS, and MERS-CoV, which causes the middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS), it represents the third most severe coronavirus disease within the past two decades, currently affecting nearly 8 million patients and with more than 500,000 deaths all over the world. COVID-19 was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, wherein a cluster of severe pneumonias occurred in people visiting a seafood and wildlife market [2, 3]. It is thought that this event specifies the origin of the current pandemic, wherein humans potentially acquired the pathogen via animal contact, although newer epidemiological data suggest that the virus might already have circulated earlier. Certain bat species are the natural reservoir for Coronaviridae, but genetic adaptation of the viruses in intermediate hosts seems to play a key role for crossing species barriers and the subsequent transmission to humans. The intermediate hosts for SARS were probably civet cats and raccoon dogs, whereas camels play this role in MERS. In COVID-19, pangolins might have served as such vectors and it is likely that from them, human infection occurred [4]. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is highly expressed on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract (e.g., bronchial transient secretory cells), endothelial cells but also on several other cell types [5]. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein, which extrudes from the virion surface, enables attachment to ACE2, and due to cleavage of the S protein by host cell proteases (e.g., via TMPRSS2), fusion of viral and cellular membranes is facilitated to enable viral host cell entry [6]. Thus, the interference of SARS-Cov-2 with multiple physiological processes in several types of cells explains the observed variety of clinical manifestations. Moreover, secondary effects mediated via inflammation and the immune response (e.g., the so-called “cytokine storm”) also seem to contribute significantly to COVID-19 [7]. Clinical manifestations as well show different grades of severity. Risk factors for the development of more severe forms are generally older age and the presence of comorbidities like coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes type II [8–10]. To that end, there is an urgent need for a better definition of the pathogenetic mechanisms and of the primary and secondary pathologies prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection to improve patient care, which could also account for the great variance in the reported case-fatality rates. Such insights might directly enable development of specific therapies to counteract COVID-19.",Published online 2020 Dec 3.,"Aging is an important factor affecting the deterioration of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aging and degeneration of various tissues and organs in the elderly lead to impaired organ function. Underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in aged patients are associated with higher mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily interacts with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and other accessory proteins such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CD147. Thus, altered receptor signals in aging and chronic disease play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are associated with a higher risk of deterioration in different organs. In this review, after a brief introduction to the link between aging and receptors for SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the risk of deterioration in different organs of COVID-19 patients considering aging as the main factor. We further discuss the structural and/or physiological changes in the immune system and organs (lung, heart, kidney, vessels, nerve system), as well as those associated with diabetes, in aging patients, and speculate on the most likely mechanisms underlying the deterioration of COVID-19 patients."

Similar to influenza, advanced age has emerged as the leading host risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. In this review we connect the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and host response to the clinical presentation of COVID-19, borrowing concepts from influenza A virus-induced ARDS pathogenesis and discussing how these ideas inform our evolving understanding of COVID-19-induced ARDS. We also consider important differences between COVID-19 and influenza, mainly the protean clinical presentation and associated lymphopenia of COVID-19, the contrasting role of interferon-γ in mediating the host immune response to these viruses, and the tropism for vascular endothelial cells of SARS-CoV-2, commenting on the potential limitations of influenza as a model for COVID-19.

In this study, using pools of overlapping linear B-cell peptides, we report two IgG immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein that are recognised by sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients. Notably, one is specific to SARS-CoV-2, which is located in close proximity to the receptor binding domain. The other region, which is localised at the fusion peptide, could potentially function as a pan-SARS target. Functionally, antibody depletion assays demonstrate that antibodies targeting these immunodominant regions significantly alter virus neutralisation capacities. Taken together, identification and validation of these neutralising B-cell epitopes will provide insights towards the design of diagnostics and vaccine candidates against this high priority coronavirus."

In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to >20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture; however, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected at a low frequency even when the number was below 1.0. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be detected in the early stage of the epidemic, even if the number of confirmed cases potentially underestimates the actual numbers of cases. This suggests that WBE approach can potentially act as an early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan."

To study SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses, we collected a total of 38 peripheral blood specimens from 13 adult patients, sampled at a median of three time points (range 1–5) each, admitted to Stanford Healthcare with COVID-19 confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) testing. Sampling time points were measured as days post-symptom onset (DPSO). All patients showed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies (Table 1 ). Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) repertoires were sequenced and compared to those from a healthy human control (HHC) dataset of 114 adults (Nielsen et al., 2019). Data from a HHC individual matched to the COVID-19 cohort by mean sequencing depth and B cell clones is shown in Figure 1 (top panel). In HHC at baseline, IgM and IgD are primarily derived from naive B cells with unmutated IGHV genes, whereas class-switched cells expressing IgA or IgG subclasses show IGHV SHM. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 seroconverted patients (blue labels in Figure 1) show a highly polyclonal burst of B cell clones expressing IgG, and to a lesser extent IgA, with little to no SHM. Data from a patient prior to and after seroconversion shows an increase in the proportion of class-switched low-SHM clones (bottom panels in Figure 1). Seronegative samples (red labels in Figure 1) had IGH repertoires similar to uninfected HHC, suggesting an earlier stage in the immune response to infection at these time points.",Published online 2020 Nov 26.,"Immune profiling of patients with COVID-19 has shown that SARS-CoV-2 causes severe lymphocyte deficiencies (e.g., lymphopenia, decreased numbers, and exhaustion of T cells) and increased levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes.

Compared to active COVID-19 patients, our results revealed that the immune profile of recovered donors was restored for most subpopulations. Nevertheless, even 2 months after recovery, CP donors still had reduced levels of CD4+ T and B cells, as well as granulocytes. CP donors with non-detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in their serum were characterized by higher Th9 and Th17 cells, which were possibly expanded at the expense of Th2 humoral immunity. The most noticeable alterations were identified in previously hospitalized CP donors, who presented the lowest levels of CD8+ regulatory T cells, the highest levels of CD56+CD16− NKT cells, and a promotion of a Th17-type phenotype, which might be associated with a prolonged pro-inflammatory response. A longer follow-up of CP donors will eventually reveal the time needed for full recovery of their immune system competence."

After virus entry in host cells the global organization of the viral life cycle is strongly regulated by the formation of virus-host protein interactions. With the advent of high-throughput -omics platforms, the mirage to obtain a “high resolution” view of virus–host interactions has come true. In fact, the rapidly expanding approaches of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in the study of PPIs provide efficient tools to identify a significant number of potential drug targets. Generation of PPIs maps by affinity purification-MS and by the more recent proximity labeling-MS may help to uncover cellular processes hijacked and/or altered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), providing promising therapeutic targets. The possibility to further validate putative key targets from high-confidence interactions between viral bait and host protein through follow-up MS-based multi-omics experiments offers an unprecedented opportunity in the drug discovery pipeline. In particular, drug repurposing, making use of already existing approved drugs directly targeting these identified and validated host interactors, might shorten the time and reduce the costs in comparison to the traditional drug discovery process. This route might be promising for finding effective antiviral therapeutic options providing a turning point in the fight against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak."

Because children were first identified as potential spreaders of the virus, schools were closed in several countries. However, it rapidly became evident that the number of hospitalized children infected by SARS-CoV-2 was dramatically lower than that of adults. To date, only hypotheses have been raised to explain this difference, so it is of great importance to describe the presentation of this disease among children. Here, we describe a wide spectrum of COVID-19 manifestation in children in a dedicated pediatric unit in France. Methods: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were diagnosed on the basis of either positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or typical aspects in chest-computed tomography (CT) were included between March and May 2020 in Paris. Results: Twenty-three patients were included on the basis of positive RT-PCR (n = 20) and/or typical aspects in CT (n = 4). The median age was 4.9 years [0.1–17.6]. Patients were grouped by age (<2 years old: n = 14, 61%; 2–10 years old: n = 2, 9%; >10 years old: n = 7, 30%). Overweight or obesity was reported in only three patients. At presentation, the most frequent symptom in the overall cohort was fever (n = 18, 78%), followed by acute rhinitis (n = 9, 64%) and cough (n = 7, 50%) in the under 2-year-old group and cough (n = 4, 57%), fatigue, dyspnea and abdominal pain (n = 3, 43% each) in the over 10-year-old group. Five patients required ICU treatment, four of whom were aged >10 years, two presented with acute myocarditis, and two were sickle cell disease patients who presented with acute chest syndrome. Discussion and conclusion: The youngest patients seem to present milder forms of COVID-19 without the need for ICU treatment and with a shorter length of hospitalization. More severe evolutions were observed in teenagers, with, however, favorable outcomes. Given the context of closed schools and confinement, the infection of these children suggests intra-familial transmission that needs to be further assessed. This description might help to understand the intriguing differences in COVID-19 severity across age-classes."

Later on January 7, 2020, the Chinese administration announced the naming of a new form of coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the Coronaviridae family (Xiao et al. 2020). It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 is 96% genetically similar to a bat coronavirus at the whole genome level (Zhou et al. 2020). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extreme acute respiratory syndrome with the most common symptoms of moderate infection include fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat or dyspnea. Patients infected with this virus suffer from other potential damage to vital organs, such as gastrointestinal, cardiac, renal, and nervous systems (Gavriatopoulou et al. 2020; Merad and Martin 2020; Rohollah et al. 2020; Bhaskar et al. 2020).

Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as it spread throughout China and subsequently across the globe.

It mainly spreads through the respiratory tract with lymphopenia and cytokine storms occuring in the blood of subjects with severe disease. This suggests the existence of immunological dysregulation as an accompanying event during severe illness caused by this virus. The early recognition of this immunological phenotype could assist prompt recognition of patients who will progress to severe disease.

After binding, the serine protease TGRBSS2 facilitates virus entry into the cell (Matricardi et al., 2020). The results of a recent study (Long et al., 2020) on COVID-19 patients showed that 100% of patients tested positive for IgG about 17–19 days following the onset of symptomatology, with a peak of 94.1% after 20–22 days. In addition, the study found that there was an increase in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibody titres after the first 3 weeks following the onset of symptomatology, but no correlation was found between IgG levels and patients’ clinical characteristics (Long et al., 2020). Following infection with SARS-CoV-2 some infected individuals may remain asymptomatic or only present with mild upper respiratory symptoms, others develop pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that requires intubation in intensive care and presents complications with an inauspicious outcome. A model (Matricardi et al., 2020) has recently been published based on literature studies in which it is emphasised that the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (IgA, IgM, MBL antibodies) is crucial in the evolution of COVID-19. In particular, this model identifies the first stage of COVID-19, which is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection, accompanied by fever, muscle fatigue and pain.

COVID-19 was rapidly spread worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020a). Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus. Betacoronaviruses are single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped RNA viruses which are responsible for respiratory infections (Yeo et al., 2020). The virus is primarily transmitted from person-to-person by exposure to respiratory droplets from infected patients (Kampf et al., 2020). However, some studies have been reported survival of human coronaviruses in the gastrointestinal tract and shedding in feces of infected patients (Kitajima et al., 2020). Information from researches on human coronaviruses especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV shows respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea after viral infection (Yeo et al., 2020). Intestinal infection in COVID-19 patients has also been reported and approximately 2–10% of cases with confirmed disease presented with diarrhea (Yeo et al., 2020). Some studies have reported detection of COVID-19 viral RNA in fecal samples of infected patients (Kitajima et al., 2020). During peak shedding, a high number of virus particles is released per gram of fecal matter of COVID-19 patients which could lead to widespread environmental dissemination of the virus through contaminated water and wastewater (Yeo et al., 2020). There are several reports of the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (Ahmed et al., 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020) with concentrations of a maximum of over 106 copies per liter of untreated wastewater (Kitajima et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020). It has been proposed that the analysis of wastewater could be a powerful tool for COVID-19 surveillance. However, the documented presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater raises the question regarding the potential transmission risk of this virus through wastewater, especially for those working with human waste and wastewater (Foladori et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Gormley et al., 2020; El Baz and Imziln, 2020; Gwenzi, 2021). Aerosols from wastewater treatment processes have the ability to carry infectious agents, including respiratory viruses, and therefore, might contribute to transmission of viral infections to the wastewater workers through aerosols/droplets produced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) (Kitajima et al., 2020). Although, no evidence has emerged to support the role of wastewater in transmission of COVID-19, the ongoing global pandemic of this viral infection highlights the need for further studies to address any public concerns related to the wastewater (Gwenzi, 2021). Rimoldi et al. (2020) suggested a low risk of infection from river water, while in the case of wastewater indicated that the risk for public health should be estimated under a precautionary approach. Evidence from an outbreak of SARS-CoV in the Amoy Gardens apartment building in Hong Kong showed that aerosolized droplets of fecally contaminated water were responsible for the spread of the viral infection in large numbers of people (McKinney et al., 2006). Structural similarities between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Corpuz et al., 2020), in combination with relatively high stability of SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosol state (Fears et al., 2020), calls for WWTPs to be considered as a potential source for transmission of COVID-19 through bioaerosols produced by wastewater treatment processes (Corpuz et al., 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020; Gwenzi, 2021). In other words, it is of considerable importance to understand the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater for the sake of wastewater workers and public health. This is particularly important in developing countries, where the personal protective equipment has received limited attention and there is a lack of efficient barrier for controlling the aerosols emitted from wastewater processes (Gwenzi, 2021).",Published online 2020 May 19.,A SARS-CoV-2 proteome peptide microarray was developed to perform the proteome-wide analysis of serum antibody’s epitopes at amino acid resolution.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and it has 3 main routes for transmission, i.e., person-to-person contact, aerosol, and touch. In addition to infecting the respiratory system, the virus also infects the blood, digestive, and urinary systems. As a result, the presence of the virus has been detected in fecal, blood, and urine samples. COVID-19 can cause a variety of symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Furthermore, hidden transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals. The incubation period for COVID-19 ranges between 2 and 14 days.",null,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major public health crisis over the past few months. Overall case fatality rates range between 2–6%; however, the rates are higher in the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Recent reports showed that about 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had underlying chronic liver disease. During the previous SARS epidemic, around 60% of patients were reported to develop various degrees of liver damage. In the current pandemic, hepatic dysfunction has been seen in 14–53% of patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with severe disease. Cases of acute liver injury have been reported and are associated with higher mortality. Hepatic involvement in COVID-19 could be related to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, an uncontrolled immune reaction, sepsis or drug-induced liver injury. The postulated mechanism of viral entry is through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are abundantly present in type 2 alveolar cells. Interestingly, ACE2 receptors are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium and cholangiocytes of the liver. The effects of COVID-19 on underlying chronic liver disease require detailed evaluation and, with data currently lacking, further research is warranted in this area."

Previous influenza pandemics showed that socioeconomic factors may determine both disease detection rates and overall outcomes, and preliminary data from the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic suggests that this is still true. Over the past years it has become clear that early-life adversity (ELA) plays a critical role biasing the immune system towards a pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype many years later. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be particularly sensitive to the early life social environment. As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19."

Although common colds, sneezing, etc. are mediated by coronaviruses, which affect the upper respiratory tracts [5], COVID-19 is a completely new type of viral disease that mainly affects the lower respiratory tracts [6]. The human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 has made it a very deadly pandemic. It is believed that the virus can move from the lower respiratory tracts to the gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system, leading to the dysfunction of multiple organs [7]. Once the virus enters humans, it grows rapidly. During this period, a high level of immune system proteins called cytokines is produced to protect cells from viral attack. However, high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)−1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can affect normal cells and tissues of the patients. This process is called a cytokine storm [8], [9], [10], [11], which ultimately contributes to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12]. Further, the elevated levels of cytokines in the blood suppress oxygen utilization in the body and leads to the failure of multiple organs [13] and eventually death. It should be mentioned that the cytokines are mainly secreted by innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, etc. that are supposed to act in the early stage of infection. However, cytokine storm occurs at the late stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, when the adaptive immune response becomes prominent.",null,null

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2.

In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease.

In addition to severe respiratory symptoms, there are a growing number of reports showing a wide range of CNS complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we review the literature on these complications, ranging from nonspecific symptoms to necrotizing encephalopathies, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, endotheliitis, and stroke. We postulate that there are several different mechanisms involved in COVID-19–associated CNS dysfunction, particularly activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and, in a few patients, a direct viral effect on the endothelium and the parenchyma. Last, critically ill patients frequently present with protracted cognitive dysfunction in the setting of septic encephalopathy likely due to multifactorial mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, but available data suggest that CNS complications in COVID-19 are rare and probably not directly caused by the virus."

Immunological aspects of the disease reflect the importance of the immune system to inhibit the viral factors and to control and regulate the pathophysiological processes during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, immune-mediated and humoral immune responses, immune memory, the cytokine storm, and neuroendocrine-immune regulation are critical factors that can determine the prognosis and outcome for patients.

Moreover, 162 serial serum samples from 31 patients were tested for seroconversion of IgM and IgG. Meanwhile, IgM and IgG were also detected in 409 COVID-19 patients and 389 controls. Additionally, the logistic regression analysis was executed to identify the possible influence factors for antibody production. The median positive conversion time for RNA was day 7 (IQR, 3–11), and the positive rate was highest in day 1–5 (74.59 %) and then gradually decreased. The median time of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were both day 12 (IQR, 10–15). The sensitivity and specificity for IgM (or IgG) was 87.04% and 96.92%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that reduced lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were independent factors for negative results of IgM and IgG. In conclusion, RNA and antibodies should be combined for COVID-19 diagnosis, and delayed seroconversion was influenced by the decreased lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for RNA."

This virus is a member of the β-Coronaviruses genus (family Coronaviridae) and is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. The common symptoms of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 include respiratory symptoms, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and central nervous system conditions leading to multiple organ failure. In more severe cases, infection causes bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney failure, and ultimately, death [5,6]. Current data on COVID-19 indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate is generally far lower (3–5%) than that of SARS-CoV (9–15%) and MERS-CoV (34–37%), but SARS-CoV-2 is much more transmissible/contagious than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses and affects more people over the age of 60 or those with comorbidities that weaken the immune system [[7], [8], [9]].

COVID-19 clinical presentation primarily affects the respiratory system causing bilateral pneumonia, but it is increasingly being recognized as a systemic disease, with neurologic manifestations reported in patients with mild symptoms but, most frequently, in those in a severe condition. Elderly individuals are at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and mortality have been very high. Community measures implemented to slow the spread of the virus have forced to social distancing and cancelation of cognitive stimulation programs, which may have contributed to generate loneliness, behavioral symptoms and worsening of cognition in patients with dementia. COVID-19 has impacted the functioning of Memory Clinics, research programs and clinical trials in the Alzheimer’s field, triggering the implementation of telemedicine. COVID-19 survivors should be periodically evaluated with comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, and specific mental health and cognitive rehabilitation programs should be provided for those suffering long-term cognitive and psychiatric sequelae."

Both these events trigger “cytokine storm” leading to acute lung and cardiovascular injury. A selective therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been identified. Clinical trials with remdesivir gave discordant results. Thus, healthcare systems have focused on “multi-targeted” therapeutic strategies aiming at relieving systemic inflammation and thrombotic complications. No randomized clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of renin angiotensin system antagonists in reducing inflammation related to COVID-19. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab showed encouraging data, but their use needs to be further validated. The still-controversial efficacy of these treatments highlighted the importance of organ injury prevention in COVID-19. Neprilysin (NEP) might be an interesting target for this purpose. NEP expression is increased by cytokines on lung fibroblasts surface. NEP activity is elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome and it is conceivable that it is also high in COVID-19. NEP is implicated in the degradation of natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, substance P, adrenomedullin, and apelin that account for prevention of organ injury. Thus, NEP/angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R) inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) may increase levels of these molecules and block AT1Rs required for ACE2 endocytosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, SAC/VAL has a positive impact on acute heart failure that is very frequently observed in deceased COVID-19 patients.
